A graphical representation of a function––here the 
number of hours of daylight as a function of the time 
of year at various latitudes–– is often the most natural 
and convenient way to represent the function. 


Functions and Models 



The fundamental objects that we deal with in calculus are 
functions. This chapter prepares the way for calculus by 
discussing the basic ideas concerning functions, their 

graphs, and ways of transforming and combining them. 
We stress that a function can be represented in different 
ways: by an equation, in a table, by a graph, or in words. We look at the main 
types of functions that occur in calculus and describe the process of using these functions 
as mathematical models of real-world phenomena. We also discuss the use of 
graphing calculators and graphing software for computers.

Functions arise whenever one quantity depends on another. Consider the following four 
situations. 

A. 
The area A of a circle depends on the radius r of the circle. The rule that connects r 
and A is given by the equation A  r2. With each positive number r there is associated 
one value of A, and we say that A is a function of .r 
B. 
The human population of the world P depends on the time t. The table gives estimates 
of the world population Ptat time t, for certain years. For instance, 
P19502,560,000,000 

But for each value of the time t there is a corresponding value of P, and we say that 
P is a function of t. 

C. 
The cost C of mailing a first-class letter depends on the weight w of the letter. 
Although there is no simple formula that connects w and C, the post office has a rule 
for determining C when w is known. 
D. 
The vertical acceleration a of the ground as measured by a seismograph during an 
earthquake is a function of the elapsed time t. Figure 1 shows a graph generated by 
seismic activity during the Northridge earthquake that shook Los Angeles in 1994. 
For a given value of t, the graph provides a corresponding value of a.

Each of these examples describes a rule whereby, given a number ( , rt, w, or t), another 

number (A, P, C, or a) is assigned. In each case we say that the second number is a func


tion of the first number. 

A function f is a rule that assigns to each element x in a set A exactly one element, 
called f x, in a set B.

We usually consider functions for which the sets and are sets of real numbers. The 
set is called the domain of the function. The number is the value of at and is 
read “ of .” The range of is the set of all possible values of as varies throughout 
the domain. A symbol that represents an arbitrary number in the domain of a function 
is called an independent variable. A symbol that represents a number in the range of 
is called a dependent variable. In Example A, for instance, r is the independent variable 
and A is the dependent variable. 
It’s helpful to think of a function as a machine (see Figure 2). If is in the domain of 
the function then when enters the machine, it’s accepted as an input and the machine 
produces an output according to the rule of the function. Thus, we can think of the 
domain as the set of all possible inputs and the range as the set of all possible outputs. 
The preprogrammed functions in a calculator are good examples of a function as a 
machine. For example, the square root key on your calculator computes such a function. 
You press the key labeled (or ) and enter the input x. If , then is not in the 
domain of this function; that is, is not an acceptable input, and the calculator will indicate 
an error. If , then an approximation to will appear in the display. Thus, the 
key on your calculator is not quite the same as the exact mathematical function defined 
by . 
Another way to picture a function is by an arrow diagram as in Figure 3. Each arrow 
connects an element of to an element of . The arrow indicates that is associated 
with is associated with , and so on. 
The most common method for visualizing a function is its graph. If is a function with 
domain , then its graph is the set of ordered pairs 
(Notice that these are input-output pairs.) In other words, the graph of consists of all 
points in the coordinate plane such that and is in the domain of . 
The graph of a function gives us a useful picture of the behavior or “life history” of 
a function. Since the -coordinate of any point on the graph is , we can read 
the value of from the graph as being the height of the graph above the point (see 
Figure 4). The graph of also allows us to picture the domain of on the -axis and its 
range on the -axis as in Figure 5.

SOLUTION 

(a) We see from Figure 6 that the point 1, 3lies on the graph of f, so the value of f at 
1 is f1 3. (In other words, the point on the graph that lies above x  1 is 3 units 
above the x-axis.) 
When x  5, the graph lies about 0.7 unit below the x-axis, so we estimate that 
f50.7. 

(b) We see that fxis defined when 0  x  7, so the domain of f is the closed interval 
0, 7	. Notice that f takes on all values from 2 to 4, so the range of f is 
y2  y  4 2, 4	 


EXAMPLE 2 Sketch the graph and find the domain and range of each function. 

(a) fx 2x  1 (b) tx x2 
SOLUTION 

(a) The equation of the graph is y  2x  1, and we recognize this as being the equation 
of a line with slope 2 and y-intercept 1. (Recall the slope-intercept form of the 
equation of a line: y  mx  b. See Appendix B.) This enables us to sketch the graph of 
f in Figure 7. The expression 2x  1 is defined for all real numbers, so the domain of f 
is the set of all real numbers, which we denote by . The graph shows that the range is 
also . 
(b) Since t2 22  4 and t1 12  1, we could plot the points 2, 4and 
1, 1, together with a few other points on the graph, and join them to produce the 
graph (Figure 8). The equation of the graph is y  x2, which represents a parabola (see 
Appendix C). The domain of t is . The range of t consists of all values of tx, that is, 
22  0

all numbers of the form x. But xfor all numbers x and any positive number y is a 
square. So the range of t is yy  0 0, . This can also be seen from Figure 8.

Representations of Functions 

There are four possible ways to represent a function: 

 

verbally (by a description in words) 

 

numerically (by a table of values) 

 

visually (by a graph) 

 

algebraically (by an explicit formula) 

If a single function can be represented in all four ways, it is often useful to go from one 
representation to another to gain additional insight into the function. (In Example 2, for 
instance, we started with algebraic formulas and then obtained the graphs.) But certain 
functions are described more naturally by one method than by another. With this in mind, 
let’s reexamine the four situations that we considered at the beginning of this section. 

A. 
The most useful representation of the area of a circle as a function of its radius is 
probably the algebraic formula Ar r2, though it is possible to compile a table of 
values or to sketch a graph (half a parabola). Because a circle has to have a positive 
radius, the domain is r r 
 0 0, , and the range is also 0, . 
B. 
We are given a description of the function in words: Ptis the human population of 
the world at time t. The table of values of world population on page 11 provides a 
convenient representation of this function. If we plot these values, we get the graph 
(called a scatter plot) in Figure 9. It too is a useful representation; the graph allows us 
to absorb all the data at once. What about a formula? Of course, it’s impossible to 
devise an explicit formula that gives the exact human population Ptat any time t. 
But it is possible to find an expression for a function that approximates Pt. In fact, 
using methods explained in Section 1.5, we obtain the approximation 
Ptf t 0.008079266	 1.013731t 

and Figure 10 shows that it is a reasonably good “fit.” The function f is called a 
mathematical model for population growth. In other words, it is a function with an 
explicit formula that approximates the behavior of our given function. We will see, 
however, that the ideas of calculus can be applied to a table of values; an explicit 
formula is not necessary.

SECTION 1.1 FOUR WAYS TO REPRESENT A FUNCTION .... 15 

The function P is typical of the functions that arise whenever we attempt to apply 

calculus to the real world. We start with a verbal description of a function. Then we 

may be able to construct a table of values of the function, perhaps from instrument 

readings in a scientific experiment. Even though we don’t have complete knowledge 

of the values of the function, we will see throughout the book that it is still possible to 

perform the operations of calculus on such a function. 

C. 
Again the function is described in words: Cw is the cost of mailing a first-class letter 
with weight w. The rule that the U.S. Postal Service used as of 2002 is as follows: 
The cost is 37 cents for up to one ounce, plus 23 cents for each successive ounce up 
to 11 ounces. The table of values shown in the margin is the most convenient representation 
for this function, though it is possible to sketch a graph (see Example 10). 
D. 
The graph shown in Figure 1 is the most natural representation of the vertical acceleration 
function at. It’s true that a table of values could be compiled, and it is even 
possible to devise an approximate formula. But everything a geologist needs to 
know—amplitudes and patterns—can be seen easily from the graph. (The same is true 
for the patterns seen in electrocardiograms of heart patients and polygraphs for lie-
detection.) Figures 11 and 12 show the graphs of the north-south and east-west accelerations 
for the Northridge earthquake; when used in conjunction with Figure 1, they 
provide a great deal of information about the earthquake.

In the next example we sketch the graph of a function that is defined verbally. 

EXAMPLE 3 When you turn on a hot-water faucet, the temperature T of the water depends 
on how long the water has been running. Draw a rough graph of T as a function of the

T 

time t that has elapsed since the faucet was turned on. 

SOLUTION The initial temperature of the running water is close to room temperature 
because of the water that has been sitting in the pipes. When the water from the hot-
water tank starts coming out, T increases quickly. In the next phase, T is constant 

t at the temperature of the heated water in the tank. When the tank is drained, T decreases 
to the temperature of the water supply. This enables us to make the rough sketch of T as 
FIGURE 13 a function of t in Figure 13.

A more accurate graph of the function in Example 3 could be obtained by using a thermometer 
to measure the temperature of the water at 10-second intervals. In general, scientists 
collect experimental data and use them to sketch the graphs of functions, as the next 
example illustrates. 

EXAMPLE 4 The data shown in the margin come from an experiment on the lactonization 
of hydroxyvaleric acid at 25C. They give the concentration Ct of this acid (in moles 
per liter) after t minutes. Use these data to draw an approximation to the graph of the 
concentration function. Then use this graph to estimate the concentration after 5 minutes. 

SOLUTION We plot the five points corresponding to the data from the table in Figure 14. 
The curve-fitting methods of Section 1.2 could be used to choose a model and graph it. 
But the data points in Figure 14 look quite well behaved, so we simply draw a smooth 
curve through them by hand as in Figure 15.

In the following example we start with a verbal description of a function in a physical 
situation and obtain an explicit algebraic formula. The ability to do this is a useful skill in 
solving calculus problems that ask for the maximum or minimum values of quantities.

EXAMPLE 5 A rectangular storage container with an open top has a volume of 10 m . The 
length of its base is twice its width. Material for the base costs $10 per square meter; 
material for the sides costs $6 per square meter. Express the cost of materials as a function 
of the width of the base. 

SOLUTION We draw a diagram as in Figure 16 and introduce notation by letting w and 2w 
be the width and length of the base, respectively, and h be the height. 

The area of the base is 2ww  2w2, so the cost, in dollars, of the material for the 
base is 102w2 . Two of the sides have area wh and the other two have area 2wh, so the 
cost of the material for the sides is 62wh  22wh	. The total cost is therefore 

C  102w2   62wh  22wh	  20w2  36wh 

To express C as a function of w alone, we need to eliminate h and we do so by using the 

3

fact that the volume is 10 m . Thus 

w2wh  10 

10 5 

which gives h  

2w2 w2 


|||| In setting up applied functions as in 
Example 5, it may be useful to review the 
principles of problem solving as discussed on 
page 80, particularly Step 1: Understand the 
Problem. 

|||| If a function is given by a formula and the 
domain is not stated explicitly, the convention is 
that the domain is the set of all numbers for 
which the formula makes sense and defines a 
real number.

EXAMPLE 6 Find the domain of each function.

(a) fx  sx  2 (b) tx 

SOLUTION 

(a) Because the square root of a negative number is not defined (as a real number), the 
domain of f consists of all values of x such that x  2  0. This is equivalent to 
x 2, so the domain is the interval 2, . 
(b) Since 
11
tx  

x2  xxx  1 

and division by 0 is not allowed, we see that tx is not defined when x  0 or x  1. 
Thus, the domain of t is 

x x  0, x  1 

which could also be written in interval notation as 

, 0  0, 1  1,  


The graph of a function is a curve in the xy-plane. But the question arises: Which curves 
in the xy-plane are graphs of functions? This is answered by the following test. 

The Vertical Line Test A curve in the xy-plane is the graph of a function of x if and 
only if no vertical line intersects the curve more than once. 

The reason for the truth of the Vertical Line Test can be seen in Figure 17. If each vertical 
line x  a intersects a curve only once, at a, b, then exactly one functional value 
is defined by fa  b. But if a line x  a intersects the curve twice, at a, b and a, c, 
then the curve can’t represent a function because a function can’t assign two different values 
to a.

For example, the parabola x  y2  2 shown in Figure 18(a) is not the graph of a function 
of x because, as you can see, there are vertical lines that intersect the parabola twice. 
The parabola, however, does contain the graphs of two functions of x. Notice that the equation 
x  y2  2 implies y2  x  2, so y  sx  2. Thus, the upper and lower halves 
of the parabola are the graphs of the functions f x  sx  2 [from Example 6(a)] and 
tx  sx  2. [See Figures 18(b) and (c).] We observe that if we reverse the roles of 
x and y, then the equation x  hy  y2  2 does define x as a function of y (with y as 
the independent variable and x as the dependent variable) and the parabola now appears as 
the graph of the function h.

Piecewise Defined Functions 

The functions in the following four examples are defined by different formulas in different 
parts of their domains. 

EXAMPLE 7 A function f is defined by 

if x  1 

f x  1  x 
x2 if x 
 1 

Evaluate f 0, f 1, and f 2 and sketch the graph. 

SOLUTION Remember that a function is a rule. For this particular function the rule is the 
following: First look at the value of the input x. If it happens that x  1, then the value 
of f x is 1  x. On the other hand, if x 
 1, then the value of f x is x2. 

Since 0  1, we have f 0  1  0  1. 

Since 1  1, we have f 1  1  1  0. 


Since 2 
 1, we have f 2  22  4. 

How do we draw the graph of f ? We observe that if x  1, then f x  1  x, so the 

part of the graph of f that lies to the left of the vertical line x  1 must coincide with 

the line y  1  x, which has slope 1 and y-intercept 1. If x 
 1, then f x  x2, so 

the part of the graph of f that lies to the right of the line x  1 must coincide with the 

1x 

graph of y  x2, which is a parabola. This enables us to sketch the graph in Figure l9. 
The solid dot indicates that the point 1, 0 is included on the graph; the open dot indicates 
that the point 1, 1 is excluded from the graph.

If a function f satisfies f x  f x for every number x in its domain, then f is called an 
even function. For instance, the function f x  x2 is even because

)
The geometric significance of an even function is that its graph is symmetric with respect 
to the y-axis (see Figure 23). This means that if we have plotted the graph of f for x  0, 
we obtain the entire graph simply by reflecting about the -axis.

y 
If f satisfies f x  f x for every number x in its domain, then f is called an odd 
function. For example, the function f x  x3 is odd because 

f x  x3  x3  f x 

The graph of an odd function is symmetric about the origin (see Figure 24). If we already 
have the graph of f for x  0, we can obtain the entire graph by rotating through 180 
about the origin.

even nor odd.

Increasing and Decreasing Functions 

The graph shown in Figure 26 rises from A to B, falls from B to C, and rises again from C 
to D. The function f is said to be increasing on the interval a, b, decreasing on b, c, and 
increasing again on c, d. Notice that if x1 and x2 are any two numbers between a and b 
with x1  x2, then f x1   f x2 . We use this as the defining property of an increasing 
function.

The modeling process 

A mathematical model is a mathematical description (often by means of a function or an 
equation) of a real-world phenomenon such as the size of a population, the demand for a 
product, the speed of a falling object, the concentration of a product in a chemical reaction, 
the life expectancy of a person at birth, or the cost of emission reductions. The purpose 
of the model is to understand the phenomenon and perhaps to make predictions about 
(Highlight comment IQBAL

blank)
future behavior. 

Figure 1 illustrates the process of mathematical modeling. Given a real-world problem, 
our first task is to formulate a mathematical model by identifying and naming the independent 
and dependent variables and making assumptions that simplify the phenomenon 
enough to make it mathematically tractable. We use our knowledge of the physical situation 
and our mathematical skills to obtain equations that relate the variables. In situations 
where there is no physical law to guide us, we may need to collect data (either from a 
library or the Internet or by conducting our own experiments) and examine the data in the 
form of a table in order to discern patterns. From this numerical representation of a function 
we may wish to obtain a graphical representation by plotting the data. The graph 
might even suggest a suitable algebraic formula in some cases. 

Formulate 

Real-world Mathematical

Real-world

Mathematical 
conclusionsInterpret 
SolveTest 
The second stage is to apply the mathematics that we know (such as the calculus that 
will be developed throughout this book) to the mathematical model that we have formulated 
in order to derive mathematical conclusions. Then, in the third stage, we take those 
mathematical conclusions and interpret them as information about the original real-world 
phenomenon by way of offering explanations or making predictions. The final step is to 
test our predictions by checking against new real data. If the predictions don’t compare 
well with reality, we need to refine our model or to formulate a new model and start the 
cycle again. 

A mathematical model is never a completely accurate representation of a physical situation—
it is an idealization. A good model simplifies reality enough to permit mathematical 
calculations but is accurate enough to provide valuable conclusions. It is important to 
realize the limitations of the model. In the end, Mother Nature has the final say. 

There are many different types of functions that can be used to model relationships 
observed in the real world. In what follows, we discuss the behavior and graphs of these 
functions and give examples of situations appropriately modeled by such functions. 

Linear Models

the function as

where m is the slope of the line and b is the y-intercept. 

A characteristic feature of linear functions is that they grow at a constant rate. For 
instance, Figure 2 shows a graph of the linear function f x  3x  2 and a table of sample 
values. Notice that whenever x increases by 0.1, the value of f x increases by 0.3. So 
f x increases three times as fast as x. Thus, the slope of the graph y  3x  2, namely 3, 
can be interpreted as the rate of change of y with respect to x.

EXAMPLE 1 

(a) As dry air moves upward, it expands and cools. If the ground temperature is 20C 
and the temperature at a height of 1 km is 10C, express the temperature T (in °C) as a 
function of the height h (in kilometers), assuming that a linear model is appropriate. 
(b) Draw the graph of the function in part (a). What does the slope represent? 
(c) What is the temperature at a height of 2.5 km? 
SOLUTION 

(a) Because we are assuming that T is a linear function of h, we can write 
T  mh  b 

We are given that T  20 when h  0, so 

20  m  0  b  b 

In other words, the y-intercept is b  20. 
We are also given that T  10 when h  1, so 

10  m  1  20 

The slope of the line is therefore m  10  20  10 and the required linear function is 

T  10h  20 

(b) The graph is sketched in Figure 3. The slope is m  10Ckm, and this represents 
the rate of change of temperature with respect to height. 
(c) At a height of h  2.5 km, the temperature is 
T  102.5  20  5C 


If there is no physical law or principle to help us formulate a model, we construct an 
empirical model, which is based entirely on collected data. We seek a curve that “fits” the 
data in the sense that it captures the basic trend of the data points.

is the line that passes through the first and last data points. The slope of this line is 

369.4  338.7 30.7 
 1.535 

2000  1980 20 

and its equation is 
C  338.7  1.535t  1980 
or 
C  1.535t  2700.6 
Equation 1 gives one possible linear model for the carbon dioxide level; it is graphed 
in Figure 5.

Although our model fits the data reasonably well, it gives values higher than most of 
the actual CO2 levels. A better linear model is obtained by a procedure from statistics

|||| A computer or graphing calculator finds the 
regression line by the method of least squares, 
which is to minimize the sum of the squares 
of the vertical distances between the data 
points and the line. The details are explained 
in Section 14.7. 

FIGURE 6 

The regression line 

called linear regression. If we use a graphing calculator, we enter the data from Table 1 
into the data editor and choose the linear regression command. (With Maple we use the 
fit[leastsquare] command in the stats package; with Mathematica we use the Fit command.) 
The machine gives the slope and y-intercept of the regression line as 

m  1.53818 b  2707.25 

So our least squares model for the CO2 level is

C  1.53818t  2707.25 

In Figure 6 we graph the regression line as well as the data points. Comparing with 
Figure 5, we see that it gives a better fit than our previous linear model.

EXAMPLE 3 Use the linear model given by Equation 2 to estimate the average CO2 level 
for 1987 and to predict the level for the year 2010. According to this model, when will 
the CO2 level exceed 400 parts per million? 

SOLUTION Using Equation 2 with t  1987, we estimate that the average CO2 level in 1987 
was 

C1987  1.538181987  2707.25 	 349.11 

This is an example of interpolation because we have estimated a value between observed 
values. (In fact, the Mauna Loa Observatory reported that the average CO2 level in 1987 
was 348.93 ppm, so our estimate is quite accurate.) 

With t  2010, we get 

C2010  1.538182010  2707.25 	 384.49 

So we predict that the average CO2 level in the year 2010 will be 384.5 ppm. This is 
an example of extrapolation because we have predicted a value outside the region of 
observations. Consequently, we are far less certain about the accuracy of our prediction. 

Using Equation 2, we see that the CO2 level exceeds 400 ppm when 

1.53818t  2707.25  400 

Solving this inequality, we get 
3107.25

SECTION 1.2 MATHEMATICAL MODELS: A CATALOG OF ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONS .... 29 

We therefore predict that the CO2 level will exceed 400 ppm by the year 2020. 
This prediction is somewhat risky because it involves a time quite remote from our 
observations. 

Polynomials 

A function P is called a polynomial if 

Px  anxn an1 xn1 a2 x2 a1 x a0 

where n is a nonnegative integer and the numbers a0, a1, a2, ..., an are constants called the 
coefficients of the polynomial. The domain of any polynomial is   	, 	. If 
the leading coefficient an  0, then the degree of the polynomial is n. For example, the 
function 

Px  2x6 x4 25 x3 s2 

is a polynomial of degree 6. 

A polynomial of degree 1 is of the form Px  mx b and so it is a linear function. 
A polynomial of degree 2 is of the form Px  ax2 bx c and is called a quadratic 
function. Its graph is always a parabola obtained

by shifting the parabola y  ax2, as we 
will see in the next section. The parabola opens upward if a 0 and downward if a 0.

30 .... CHAPTER 1 FUNCTIONS AND MODELS 

Polynomials are commonly used to model various quantities that occur in the natural 
and social sciences. For instance, in Section 3.3 we will explain why economists often 
use a polynomial Px to represent the cost of producing x units of a commodity. In the 
following example we use a quadratic function to model the fall of a ball. 

TABLE 2 
EXAMPLE 4 A ball is dropped from the upper observation deck of the CN Tower, 450 m 
above the ground, and its height h above the ground is recorded at 1-second intervals in 
Table 2. Find a model to fit the data and use the model to predict the time at which the 
ball hits the ground. 

SOLUTION We draw a scatter plot of the data in Figure 9 and observe that a linear model is 
inappropriate. But it looks as if the data points might lie on a parabola, so we try a quadratic 
model instead. Using a graphing calculator or computer algebra system (which 
uses the least squares method), we obtain the following quadratic model:

Quadratic model for a falling ball 

In Figure 10 we plot the graph of Equation 3 together with the data points and see 
that the quadratic model gives a very good fit. 
The ball hits the ground when h  0, so we solve the quadratic equation 

4.90t2  0.96t  449.36  0 
The quadratic formula gives

The positive root is t 	 9.67, so we predict that the ball will hit the ground after about 

9.7 seconds. 
Power Functions 

A function of the form f x  xa, where a is a constant, is called a power function. We 
consider several cases. 

(i) a  n, where n is a positive integer 
n

The graphs of f x  xfor n  1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are shown in Figure 11. (These are polynomials 
with only one term.) We already know the shape of the graphs of y  x (a line 
through the origin with slope 1) and y  x2 [a parabola, see Example 2(b) in Section 1.1].

The general shape of the graph of f x  xdepends on whether n is even or odd. 

n

If n is even, then f x  xis an even function and its graph is similar to the parabola 
y  x2. If n is odd, then f x  xn is an odd function and its graph is similar to that 
of y  x3. Notice from Figure 12, however, that as n increases, the graph of y  xn 
becomes flatter near 0 and steeper when  x   1. (If x is small, then x2 is smaller, x3 is 
even smaller, x4 is smaller still, and so on.)

The function f x  x sx is a root function. For n  2 it is the square root function 
f x  sx, whose domain is 0, 	 and whose graph is the upper half of the 
parabola x  y2. [See Figure 13(a).] For other even values of n, the graph of y  snx is

similar to that of y  sx. For n  3 we have the cube root function f x  sx whose 
domain is  (recall that every real number has a cube root) and whose graph is shown in 

n 3

Figure 13(b). The graph of y  sx for n odd n  3 is similar to that of y  sx.

The graph of the reciprocal function fx  x1  1x is shown in Figure 14. Its graph 
has the equation y  1x, or xy  1, and is a hyperbola with the coordinate axes as its 
asymptotes. 

This function arises in physics and chemistry in connection with Boyle’s Law, which 

says that, when the temperature is constant, the volume V of a gas is inversely propor

A rational function f is a ratio of two polynomials: 

Px 

fx  

Qx 

where P and Q are polynomials. The domain consists of all values of x such that Qx  0. 
A simple example of a rational function is the function f x  1x, whose domain is 
x x  0; this is the reciprocal function graphed in Figure 14. The function

Algebraic Functions 

A function f is called an algebraic function if it can be constructed using algebraic operations 
(such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and taking roots) starting 
with polynomials. Any rational function is automatically an algebraic function. Here are 
two more examples:

a variety of shapes. Figure 17 illustrates some of the possibilities.

particle with velocity v is 

m0 

m  f v  

s1  v2c2 

where m0 is the rest mass of the particle and c  3.0  105 kms is the speed of light in 
a vacuum. 

Trigonometric Functions 

Trigonometry and the trigonometric functions are reviewed on Reference Page 2 and also 
in Appendix D. In calculus the convention is that radian measure is always used (except 
when otherwise indicated). For example, when we use the function f x  sin x, it is 
understood that sin x means the sine of the angle whose radian measure is x. Thus, the 
graphs of the sine and cosine functions are as shown in Figure 18.

Notice that for both the sine and cosine functions the domain is ,  and the range 
is the closed interval 1, 1	. Thus, for all values of x, we have 

1  sin x  1 1  cos x  1 

or, in terms of absolute values, 
 sin x   1  cos x   1

Also, the zeros of the sine function occur at the integer multiples of 


; that is, 
sin x  0 when 

x  n
 

n an integer 

An important property of the sine and cosine functions is that they are periodic func

. This means that, for all values of 

x, 

sinx  2
  sin x 

cosx  2
  cos x 

The periodic nature of these functions makes them suitable for modeling repetitive phenomena 
such as tides, vibrating springs, and sound waves. For instance, in Example 4 in 
Section 1.3 we will see that a reasonable model for the number of hours of daylight in 
Philadelphia t days after January 1 is given by the function

will study transcendental functions that are defined as sums of infinite series.

In this section we start with the basic functions we discussed in Section 1.2 and obtain new 
functions by shifting, stretching, and reflecting their graphs. We also show how to combine 
pairs of functions by the standard arithmetic operations and by composition. 

Transformations of Functions 

By applying certain transformations to the graph of a given function we can obtain the 
graphs of certain related functions. This will give us the ability to sketch the graphs of 
many functions quickly by hand. It will also enable us to write equations for given graphs. 
Let’s first consider translations. If c is a positive number, then the graph of y  fx  c is 
just the graph of y  fx shifted upward a distance of c units (because each y-coordinate 
is increased by the same number c). Likewise, if tx  fx  c, where c 	 0, then the 
value of t at x is the same as the value of f at x  c (c units to the left of x). Therefore, 
the graph of y  fx  c is just the graph of y  fx shifted c units to the right (see 
Figure 1). 

Vertical and Horizontal Shifts Suppose c 	 0. To obtain the graph of 
y  fx  c, shift the graph of y  fx a distance c units upward 
y  fx  c, shift the graph of y  fx a distance c units downward 
y  fx  c, shift the graph of y  fx a distance c units to the right 
y  fx  c, shift the graph of y  fx a distance c units to the left 

Now let’s consider the stretching and reflecting transformations. If c 	 1, then the 
graph of y  cfx is the graph of y  fx stretched by a factor of c in the vertical 
direction (because each y-coordinate is multiplied by the same number c). The graph of

replaced by the point x, y. (See Figure 2 and the following chart, where the results of 
other stretching, compressing, and reflecting transformations are also given.)

y  cfx, stretch the graph of y  fx vertically by a factor of c 

y  1cfx, compress the graph of y  fx vertically by a factor of c

y  fx, reflect the graph of y  fx about the x-axis

Figure 3 illustrates these stretching transformations when applied to the cosine function 
with c  2. For instance, in order to get the graph of y  2cos x we multiply the 
y-coordinate of each point on the graph of y  cos x by 2. This means that the graph of 
y  cos x gets stretched vertically by a factor of 2.

y  sx  2, y  sx, y  2sx, and y  sx. 

SOLUTION The graph of the square root function y  sx, obtained from Figure 13 in Section 
1.2, is shown in Figure 4(a). In the other parts of the figure we sketch y  sx  2 
by shifting 2 units downward, y  sx  2 by shifting 2 units to the right, y  sx by 
reflecting about the x-axis, y  2sx by stretching vertically by a factor of 2, and 
y  sx by reflecting about the y-axis.

SOLUTION Notice that each curve resembles a shifted and stretched sine function. By looking 
at the blue curve we see that, at the latitude of Philadelphia, daylight lasts about 

14.8 hours on June 21 and 9.2 hours on December 21, so the amplitude of the curve (the 
factor by which we have to stretch the sine curve vertically) is 21 14.8  9.2  2.8. 
By what factor do we need to stretch the sine curve horizontally if we measure the 
time t in days? Because there are about 365 days in a year, the period of our model 

should be 365. But the period of y  sin t is 

2
, so the horizontal stretching factor is 

c  2
365

. 


We also notice that the curve begins its cycle on March 21, the 80th day of the year, 
so we have to shift the curve 80 units to the right. In addition, we shift it 12 units 
upward. Therefore, we model the length of daylight in Philadelphia on the tth day of 
the year by the function

Another transformation of some interest is taking the absolute value of a function. If 
y   f x, then according to the definition of absolute value, y  f x when f x  0 and 
y  f x when f x  0. This tells us how to get the graph of y   f x from the graph

of y  f x: The part of the graph that lies above the x-axis remains the same; the part that 
lies below the x-axis is reflected about the x-axis. 

EXAMPLE 5 Sketch the graph of the function y   x2  1 . 

SOLUTION We first graph the parabola y  x2  1 in Figure 10(a) by shifting the parabola 
y  x2 downward 1 unit. We see that the graph lies below the x-axis when 1  x  1, 
so we reflect that part of the graph about the x-axis to obtain the graph of y   x2  1 
in Figure 10(b).

Combinations of Functions 


Two functions f and t can be combined to form new functions f  t, f  t, ft, and ft in 
a manner similar to the way we add, subtract, multiply, and divide real numbers. 

If we define the sum f  t by the equation 

1 
 f  tx  f x  tx 

then the right side of Equation 1 makes sense if both f x and tx are defined, that is, if 
x belongs to the domain of f and also to the domain of t. If the domain of f is A and the 
domain of t is B, then the domain of f  t is the intersection of these domains, that is, 
A  B. 

Notice that the  sign on the left side of Equation 1 stands for the operation of addition 
of functions, but the  sign on the right side of the equation stands for addition of the 
numbers f x and tx. 

Similarly, we can define the difference f  t and the product ft, and their domains are 
also A  B. But in defining the quotient ft we must remember not to divide by 0. 

Algebra of Functions Let f and t be functions with domains A and B. Then the 
functions f  t, f  t, ft, and ft are defined as follows: 

 f  tx  f x  tx domain  A  B 
 f  tx  f x  tx domain  A  B

EXAMPLE 6 If f x  sx and tx  s4  x2, find the functions f  t, f  t, ft, 
and ft. 

SOLUTION The domain of f x  sx is 0, . The domain of tx  s4  x2 consists 
of all numbers x such that 4  x2  0, that is, x2  4. Taking square roots of both sides, 
we get  x   2, or 2  x  2, so the domain of t is the interval 2, 2	. The intersection 
of the domains of f and t is 

0,   2, 2	  0, 2	 
Thus, according to the definitions, we have 

 f  tx  sx  s4  x2 0  x  2 

 f  tx  sx  s4  x2 0  x  2

Notice that the domain of ft is the interval 0, 2; we have to exclude x  2 because 
t2  0. 

The graph of the function f  t is obtained from the graphs of f and t by graphical 
addition. This means that we add corresponding y-coordinates as in Figure 11. Figure 12 
shows the result of using this procedure to graph the function f  t from Example 6.

Composition of Functions 

There is another way of combining two functions to get a new function. For example, 
suppose that y  f u  su and u  tx  x2  1. Since y is a function of u and u is, 
in turn, a function of x, it follows that y is ultimately a function of x. We compute this by 
substitution: 

y  f u  f tx  f x2  1  sx2  1 


44 .... CHAPTER 1 FUNCTIONS AND MODELS 

The procedure is called composition because the new function is composed of the two 
given functions f and t. 

In general, given any two functions f and t, we start with a number x in the domain of 
t and find its image tx. If this number tx is in the domain of f , then we can calculate 
the value of f tx. The result is a new function hx  f tx obtained by substituting 
t into f . It is called the composition (or composite) of f and t and is denoted by f  t 
(“f circle t”). 

Definition Given two functions f and t, the composite function f  t (also called 
the composition of f and t) is defined by 

 f  tx  f tx 

The domain of f  t is the set of all x in the domain of t such that tx is in the domain 
of f . In other words,  f  tx is defined whenever both tx and f tx are defined. The 
best way to picture f  t is by either a machine diagram (Figure 13) or an arrow diagram 
(Figure 14).

| NOTE You can see from Example 7 that, in general, f  t  t  f . Remember, the 
notation f  t means that the function t is applied first and then f is applied second. In 
Example 7, f  t is the function that first subtracts 3 and then squares; t  f is the function 
that first squares and then subtracts 3.

2 sx 0, that is, sx 2, or x 4. Thus, we have 0 x 4, so the domain of

This expression is defined when 2 x 0, that is, x 2, and 2 s2 x 0. This 
latter inequality is equivalent to s2 x 2, or 2 x 4, that is, x 2. Thus, 
2 x 2, so the domain of t  t is the closed interval 2, 2	. 

It is possible to take the composition of three or more functions. For instance, the composite 
function f  t  h is found by first applying h, then t, and then f as follows:

So far we have used composition to build complicated functions from simpler ones. But 

in calculus it is often useful to be able to decompose a complicated function into simpler 

ones, as in the following example. 

EXAMPLE 10 Given Fx  cos2x 9, find functions f , t, and h such that F  f  t  h. 

SOLUTION Since Fx  cosx 9	2, the formula for F says: First add 9, then take the 
cosine of the result, and finally square. So we let 

hx  x 9 tx  cos xf x  x2 

Then 

 f  t  hx  f thx  f tx 9  f cosx 9

In this section we assume that you have access to a graphing calculator or a computer with 
graphing software. We will see that the use of such a device enables us to graph more complicated 
functions and to solve more complex problems than would otherwise be possible. 
We also point out some of the pitfalls that can occur with these machines. 

Graphing calculators and computers can give very accurate graphs of functions. But we 
will see in Chapter 4 that only through the use of calculus can we be sure that we have 
uncovered all the interesting aspects of a graph. 

A graphing calculator or computer displays a rectangular portion of the graph of a function 
in a display window or viewing screen, which we refer to as a viewing rectangle. 
The default screen often gives an incomplete or misleading picture, so it is important to 
choose the viewing rectangle with care. If we choose the x-values to range from a minimum 
value of Xmin  a to a maximum value of Xmax  b and the y-values to range from 


(a, d) y=d (b, d)

lies in the rectangle

  x, y a  x  b, c  y  d 

shown in Figure 1. We refer to this rectangle as the 	a, b
 by 	c, d
 viewing rectangle. 

The machine draws the graph of a function f much as you would. It plots points of the 
form x, f x for a certain number of equally spaced values of x between a and b. If an 
x-value is not in the domain of f , or if f x lies outside the viewing rectangle, it moves on 
to the next x-value. The machine connects each point to the preceding plotted point to form 
a representation of the graph of f . 

EXAMPLE 1 Draw the graph of the function f x  x2  3 in each of the following viewing 
rectangles. 

(a) 	2, 2
 by 	2, 2
 (b) 	4, 4

(c) 	10, 10
 by 	5, 30
 (d) 	50, 50
 by 	100, 1000
 
SOLUTION For part (a) we select the range by setting Xmin  2, Xmax  2, Ymin  2, 
and Ymax  2. The resulting graph is shown in Figure 2(a). The display window is 
blank! A moment’s thought provides the explanation: Notice that x2 	 0 for all x, so 
x2  3 	 3 for all x. Thus, the range of the function f x  x2  3 is 	3, 
. This 
means that the graph of f lies entirely outside the viewing rectangle 	2, 2
 by 	2, 2
. 

The graphs for the viewing rectangles in parts (b), (c), and (d) are also shown in 
Figure 2. Observe that we get a more complete picture in parts (c) and (d), but in part (d) 
it is not clear that the y-intercept is 3.

We see from Example 1 that the choice of a viewing rectangle can make a big difference 
in the appearance of a graph. Sometimes it’s necessary to change to a larger viewing 
rectangle to obtain a more complete picture, a more global view, of the graph. In the next 
example we see that knowledge of the domain and range of a function sometimes provides 
us with enough information to select a good viewing rectangle. 

EXAMPLE 2 Determine an appropriate viewing rectangle for the function 
f x  s8  2x2 and use it to graph f . 

SOLUTION The expression for f x is defined when 

8  2x2 	 0 &? 2x2  8 &? x2  4 

&?  x   2 &? 2  x  2


50 .... CHAPTER 1 FUNCTIONS AND MODELS 


Therefore, the domain of f is the interval 	2, 2
. Also, 

0  s8  2x2  s8  2s2  2.83 

so the range of f is the interval [0, 2s2]. 

3 We choose the viewing rectangle so that the x-interval is somewhat larger than the 
domain and the y-interval is larger than the range. Taking the viewing rectangle to be 
_1 	3, 3
 by 	1, 4
, we get the graph shown in Figure 3. 

_3 


FIGURE 3 

EXAMPLE 3 Graph the function y  x3  150x. 

SOLUTION Here the domain is , the set of all real numbers. That doesn’t help us choose a 

5 
viewing rectangle. Let’s experiment. If we start with the viewing rectangle 	5, 5
 by 
	5, 5
, we get the graph in Figure 4. It appears blank, but actually the graph is so 
nearly vertical that it blends in with the y-axis. 

If we change the viewing rectangle to 	20, 20
 by 	20, 20
, we get the picture 

5 

shown in Figure 5(a). The graph appears to consist of vertical lines, but we know that 
can’t be correct. If we look carefully while the graph is being drawn, we see that the 
graph leaves the screen and reappears during the graphing process. This indicates that 
we need to see more in the vertical direction, so we change the viewing rectangle to 

_5 

	20, 20
 by 	500, 500
. The resulting graph is shown in Figure 5(b). It still doesn’t 

FIGURE 4 

quite reveal all the main features of the function, so we try 	20, 20
 by 	1000, 1000
 
in Figure 5(c). Now we are more confident that we have arrived at an appropriate viewing 
rectangle. In Chapter 4 we will be able to see that the graph shown in Figure 5(c) 
does indeed reveal all the main features of the function.

EXAMPLE 4 Graph the function in an appropriate viewing rectangle. f x  sin 50x 
SOLUTION Figure 6(a) shows the graph of produced by a graphing calculator using the 
viewing rectangle by . At first glance the graph appears to be reasonable. 
But if we change the viewing rectangle to the ones shown in the following parts 
of Figure 6, the graphs look very different. Something strange is happening. 
In order to explain the big differences in appearance of these graphs and to find an 
appropriate viewing rectangle, we need to find the period of the function y  sin 50x.

We know that the function y  sin x has period

and the graph of y  sin 50x is 

compressed horizontally by a factor of 50, so the period of y  sin 50x is

This suggests that we should deal only with small values of in order to show just a few x 
1.5 oscillations of the graph. If we choose the viewing rectangle by ,	1.5, 1.5
	0.25, 0.25
 

.25 
we get the graph shown in Figure 7. 
Now we see what went wrong in Figure 6. The oscillations of are so rapid 
that when the calculator plots points and joins them, it misses most of the maximum and 
minimum points and therefore gives a very misleading impression of the graph. 
y  sin 50x 
FIGURE 7 
ƒ=sin 50x 
We have seen that the use of an inappropriate viewing rectangle can give a misleading 
impression of the graph of a function. In Examples 1 and 3 we solved the problem by 
changing to a larger viewing rectangle. In Example 4 we had to make the viewing rectangle 
smaller. In the next example we look at a function for which there is no single viewing 
rectangle that reveals the true shape of the graph. 
EXAMPLE 5 Graph the function .f x  sin x  1 
100 cos 100x 
SOLUTION Figure 8 shows the graph of produced by a graphing calculator with viewing 
rectangle by . It looks much like the graph of , but perhaps 
with some bumps attached. If we zoom in to the viewing rectangle by 
, we can see much more clearly the shape of these bumps in Figure 9. The 
reason for this behavior is that the second term, , is very small in comparison 
with the first term, . Thus, we really need two graphs to see the true nature of this 
function.

SOLUTION Figure 10(a) shows the graph produced by a graphing calculator with 
viewing rectangle 	9, 9
 by 	9, 9
. In connecting successive points on the graph, the 
calculator produced a steep line segment from the top to the bottom of the screen. That 
line segment is not truly part of the graph. Notice that the domain of the function 
y  11  x is x  x  1. We can eliminate the extraneous near-vertical line by experimenting 
with a change of scale. When we change to the smaller viewing rectangle 
	4.7, 4.7
 by 	4.7, 4.7
 on this particular calculator, we obtain the much better graph 
in Figure 10(b).

SOLUTION Some graphing devices display the graph shown in Figure 11, whereas others 
produce a graph like that in Figure 12. We know from Section 1.2 (Figure 13) that the 
graph in Figure 12 is correct, so what happened in Figure 11? The explanation is that 
some machines compute the cube root of x using a logarithm, which is not defined if x is 
negative, so only the right half of the graph is produced.

To understand how the expression for a function relates to its graph, it’s helpful to graph 
a family of functions, that is, a collection of functions whose equations are related. In the 
next example we graph members of a family of cubic polynomials.

EXAMPLE 8 Graph the function y  x3  cx for various values of the number c. How 
does the graph change when c is changed? 

SOLUTION Figure 13 shows the graphs of y  x3  cx for c  2, 1, 0, 1, and 2. We 
see that, for positive values of c, the graph increases from left to right with no maximum 
or minimum points (peaks or valleys). When c  0, the curve is flat at the origin. When 
c is negative, the curve has a maximum point and a minimum point. As c decreases, the 
maximum point becomes higher and the minimum point lower.

further to the viewing rectangle 	0.7, 0.8

 in Figure 14(c). By moving the 
cursor to the intersection point of the two curves, or by inspection and the fact that the 
x-scale is 0.01, we see that the root of the equation is about 0.74. (Many calculators have 
a built-in intersection feature.)

|||| 1.5 Exponential Functions 

The function f x  2x is called an exponential function because the variable, x, is the 
exponent. It should not be confused with the power function tx  x2, in which the variable 
is the base. 

In general, an exponential function is a function of the form 

f x  ax 

where a is a positive constant. Let’s recall what this means. 
If x  n, a positive integer, then 

an  a  a    a

But what is the meaning of ax if x is an irrational number? For instance, what is meant by 

2s3 

or 

5


? 


To help us answer this question we first look at the graph of the function y  2x, where 
x is rational. A representation of this graph is shown in Figure 1. We want to enlarge the 
domain of y  2x to include both rational and irrational numbers. 

There are holes in the graph in Figure 1 corresponding to irrational values of x. We want 
to fill in the holes by defining f x  2x, where x  , so that f is an increasing function. 
In particular, since the irrational number s3 satisfies

cases the x-axis is a horizontal asymptote. 
These matters are discussed in Section 2.6.

we must have 

21.7  2s3  21.8 
21.7 21.8
and we know what and mean because 1.7 and 1.8 are rational numbers. Similarly, 
if we use better approximations for s3, we obtain better approximations for 2s3: 

21.73  2s3  21.74
1.73  s3  1.74 ? 
21.732  2s3  21.733

1.73205  s3  1.73206 ? 

.. ..

It can be shown that there is exactly one number that is greater than all of the numbers 

21.7 , 21.73 , 21.732 , 21.7320 , 21.73205 , ... 
and less than all of the numbers 
21.8 , 21.74 , 21.733 , 21.7321 , 21.73206 , ... 

We define 2s3 to be this number. Using the preceding approximation process we can compute 
it correct to six decimal places: 

2s3  3.321997 

2xx

Similarly, we can define (or a, if a  0) where x is any irrational number. Figure 2 
shows how all the holes in Figure 1 have been filled to complete the graph of the function 
f x  2x , x  . 

The graphs of members of the family of functions y  ax are shown in Figure 3 for various 
values of the base a. Notice that all of these graphs pass through the same point 0, 1 
because a0  1 for a  0. Notice also that as the base a gets larger, the exponential function 
grows more rapidly (for x  0).

You can see from Figure 3 that there are basically three kinds of exponential functions 
y  ax. If 0  a  1, the exponential function decreases; if a  1, it is a constant; and if 
a  1, it increases. These three cases are illustrated in Figure 4. Observe that if a  1,

then the exponential function y  ax has domain  and range 0, . Notice also that,

the following thought experiment. Suppose we 
start with a piece of paper a thousandth of an

time we fold the paper in half, the thickness of 
the paper doubles, so the thickness of the 
resulting paper would be 2501000 inches. How

more than 17 million miles!

FIGURE 6 
The exponential function occurs very frequently in mathematical models of nature and 
society. Here we indicate briefly how it arises in the description of population growth 
and radioactive decay. In later chapters we will pursue these and other applications in 
greater detail. 

First we consider a population of bacteria in a homogeneous nutrient medium. Suppose 
that by sampling the population at certain intervals it is determined that the population 
doubles every hour. If the number of bacteria at time t is pt, where t is measured in hours, 
and the initial population is p0  1000, then we have 

p1  2p0  2  1000 

p2  2p1  22  1000 

p3  2p2  23  1000 

It seems from this pattern that, in general, 

pt  2t  1000  10002t 

This population function is a constant multiple of the exponential function y  2t, so it 
exhibits the rapid growth that we observed in Figures 2 and 7. Under ideal conditions 
(unlimited space and nutrition and freedom from disease) this exponential growth is typical 
of what actually occurs in nature. 

What about the human population? Table 1 shows data for the population of the world 
in the 20th century and Figure 8 shows the corresponding scatter plot.

Figure 9 shows the graph of this exponential function together with the original data

slow population growth is explained by the two world wars and the Great Depression 
of the 1930s.

Of all possible bases for an exponential function, there is one that is most convenient for 

the purposes of calculus. The choice of a base a is influenced by the way the graph of 
xy  2x

y  acrosses the y-axis. Figures 11 and 12 show the tangent lines to the graphs of 
and y  3x at the point 0, 1. (Tangent lines will be defined precisely in Section 2.7. For 
present purposes, you can think of the tangent line to an exponential graph at a point as the 
line that touches the graph only at that point.) If we measure the slopes of these tangent 
lines at 0, 1, we find that m  0.7 for y  2x and m  1.1 for y  3x .

It turns out, as we will see in Chapter 3, that some of the formulas of calculus will be 
greatly simplified if we choose the base a so that the slope of the tangent line to y  ax at 
0, 1 is exactly 1 (see Figure 13). In fact, there is such a number (as we will see in Section 
5.6) and it is denoted by the letter e. (This notation was chosen by the Swiss mathematician 
Leonhard Euler in 1727, probably because it is the first letter of the word 
exponential.) In view of Figures 11 and 12, it comes as no surprise that the number e lies 
between 2 and 3 and the graph of y  ex lies between the graphs of y  2x and y  3x. (See 
Figure 14.) In Chapter 3 we will see that the value of e, correct to five decimal places, is

Table 1 gives data from an experiment in which a bacteria culture started with 100 bacteria 
in a limited nutrient medium; the size of the bacteria population was recorded at hourly 
intervals. The number of bacteria N is a function of the time t: N  f t. 

Suppose, however, that the biologist changes her point of view and becomes interested 
in the time required for the population to reach various levels. In other words, she is think-

f 1

ing of t as a function of N. This function is called the inverse function of f, denoted by , 
and read “f inverse.” Thus, t  f 1N is the time required for the population level to reach 

N. The values of f 1 can be found by reading Table 1 from right to left or by consulting 
Table 2. For instance, f 1550  6 because f 6  550.

If a horizontal line intersects the graph of f in more than one point, then we see from 
Figure 2 that there are numbers x1 and x2 such that f x1   f x2 . This means that f is not 
one-to-one. Therefore, we have the following geometric method for determining whether 
a function is one-to-one. 

Horizontal Line Test A function is one-to-one if and only if no horizontal line intersects 
its graph more than once. 

EXAMPLE 1 Is the function f x  x3 one-to-one? 

SOLUTION 1 If x1  x2, then x13  x32 (two different numbers can’t have the same cube). 
Therefore, by Definition 1, f x  x3 is one-to-one. 

SOLUTION 2 From Figure 3 we see that no horizontal line intersects the graph of f x  x3 
more than once. Therefore, by the Horizontal Line Test, f is one-to-one. 


EXAMPLE 2 Is the function tx  x2 one-to-one? 
SOLUTION 1 This function is not one-to-one because, for instance, 


t1  1  t1 
and so 1 and 1 have the same output. 
SOLUTION 2 From Figure 4 we see that there are horizontal lines that intersect the graph of 

t more than once. Therefore, by the Horizontal Line Test, t is not one-to-one. 
One-to-one functions are important because they are precisely the functions that possess 
inverse functions according to the following definition.

This definition says that if f maps x into y, then f 1 maps y back into x. (If f were not 
one-to-one, then f 1 would not be uniquely defined.) The arrow diagram in Figure 5 indif

cates that reverses the effect of f . Note that

| CAUTION Do not mistake the 1 in f 1 for an exponent. Thus 
1 

f 1x does not mean 

f x 

The reciprocal 1f x could, however, be written as  f x1. 
EXAMPLE 3 If f 1  5, f 3  7, and f 8  10, find f 17, f 15, and f 110.

SOLUTION From the definition of we have 
f 17  3 because f 3  7 
f 15  1 because f 1  5 
f 110  8 because f 8  10 


f 1

The diagram in Figure 6 makes it clear how reverses the effect of f in this case. 


The letter x is traditionally used as the independent variable, so when we concentrate 
on f 1 rather than on f, we usually reverse the roles of x and y in Definition 2 and write 

3 
f 1x  y &? f y  x 

By substituting for y in Definition 2 and substituting for x in (3), we get the following 
cancellation equations: 

4 
f 1 f x  x for every x in A 
f  f 1x  x for every x in B 



66 .... CHAPTER 1 FUNCTIONS AND MODELS 

The first cancellation equation says that if we start with x, apply f , and then apply f 1, we 
arrive back at x, where we started (see the machine diagram in Figure 7). Thus, f 1 undoes 
what f does. The second equation says that f undoes what f 1 does.

effect of f . The function f is the rule “Cube, 
then add 2”; f 1is the rule “Subtract 2, then 
take the cube root.” 

|||| In Example 4, notice how reverses the

For example, if f x  x, then f 1x  xand so the cancellation equations become 

3 13  x

f 1 f x  x13 3  x

f  f 1x  x

These equations simply say that the cube function and the cube root function cancel each 
other when applied in succession. 

Now let’s see how to compute inverse functions. If we have a function y  f x and are 
able to solve this equation for x in terms of y, then according to Definition 2 we must have 
x  f 1y. If we want to call the independent variable x, we then interchange x and y and 
arrive at the equation y  f 1x. 

How to Find the Inverse Function of a One-to-One Function f 
STEP 1 Write . 
STEP 2 Solve this equation for in terms of (if possible). 
STEP 3 To express as a function of x, interchange and . 
The resulting equation is .y  f 1x

EXAMPLE 4 Find the inverse function of f x  x3  2. 

SOLUTION According to (5) we first write 

y  x3  2 

Then we solve this equation for x: 

x3  y  2 

x  s3 y  2 

Finally, we interchange x and y: 

y  s3 x  2 

3

Therefore, the inverse function is f 1x  sx  2. 


The principle of interchanging x and y to find the inverse function also gives us the 
method for obtaining the graph of f 1 from the graph of f . Since f a  b if and only if 
f 1b  a, the point a, b is on the graph of f if and only if the point b, a is on the 
graph of f 1. But we get the point b, a from a, b by reflecting about the line y  x

. (See 
Figure 8.)

The graph of f 1 is obtained by reflecting the graph of f about the line y  x. 

EXAMPLE 5 Sketch the graphs of f x  s1  x and its inverse function using the 

same coordinate axes. 

SOLUTION First we sketch the curve y  s1  x (the top half of the parabola 
y2  1  x, or x  y2  1) and then we reflect about the line y  x to get the 
graph of f 1. (See Figure 10.) As a check on our graph, notice that the expression for 

f 1 f 1x  xf 1

is 2  1, x  0. So the graph of is the right half of the parabola 
FIGURE 10 y  x2  1 and this seems reasonable from Figure 10. 

Logarithmic Functions 

If a  0 and a  1, the exponential function f x  ax is either increasing or decreasing 
f 1

and so it is one-to-one by the Horizontal Line Test. It therefore has an inverse function , 
which is called the logarithmic function with base a and is denoted by loga. If we use the 
formulation of an inverse function given by (3), 

f 1x  y &? f y  x 

then we have 

6 
logax  y &? ay  x 

Thus, if x  0, then logax is the exponent to which the base a must be raised to give x. For 
example, log10 0.001  3 because 103  0.001. 
The cancellation equations (4), when applied to the functions f x  ax and 
f 1x  logax, become 

7 
logaax   x for every x   

logax

a x for every x  0

The logarithmic function loga has domain 0,  and range . Its graph is the reflection 
of the graph of y  ax about the line y  x.

|||| NOTATION FOR LOGARITHMS 

Most textbooks in calculus and the sciences, 
as well as calculators, use the notation ln x for 
the natural logarithm and log x for the “common 
logarithm,” log10 x. In the more advanced 
mathematical and scientific literature and in 
computer languages, however, the notation 
log x usually denotes the natural logarithm. 

Figure 11 shows the case where a  1. (The most important logarithmic functions have 
base a  1.) The fact that y  ax is a very rapidly increasing function for x  0 is 
reflected in the fact that y  logax is a very slowly increasing function for x  1. 

Figure 12 shows the graphs of y  logax with various values of the base a. Since 
loga 1  0, the graphs of all logarithmic functions pass through the point 1, 0. 

The following properties of logarithmic functions follow from the corresponding properties 
of exponential functions given in Section 1.5.

2. logax logax  logay

3. logaxr  r logax (where r is any real number) 
EXAMPLE 6 Use the laws of logarithms to evaluate log280  log2 5. 
SOLUTION Using Law 2, we have 

log2 80  log2 5  log280  log2 16  4

because 24  16. 

Natural Logarithms 

Of all possible bases a for logarithms, we will see in Chapter 3 that the most convenient 
choice of a base is the number e, which was defined in Section 1.5. The logarithm with 
base e is called the natural logarithm and has a special notation: 

logex  ln x 

If we put a  e and replace loge with “ln” in (6) and (7), then the defining properties 
of the natural logarithm function become 

9 
8 
ln x  y &? ey  x 
lnex  x x   
eln x  x x  0

In particular, if we set x  1, we get 

ln e  1 


SECTION 1.6 INVERSE FUNCTIONS AND LOGARITHMS .... 69 
EXAMPLE 7 Find x if ln x  5. 
SOLUTION 1 From (8) we see that 
ln x  5 means ex if ln x  5. 
SOLUTION 1 From (8) we see that 
ln x  5 means e5  x 
Therefore, x  e5. 
(If you have trouble working with the “ln” notation, just replace it by loge. Then the 
equation becomes logex  5; so, by the definition of logarithm, e5  x.) 
SOLUTION 2 Start with the equation 
ln x  5 
and apply the exponential function to both sides of the equation: 

ln x  e5

eln x  x 5

But the second cancellation equation in (9) says that e. Therefore, x  e. 
EXAMPLE 8 Solve the equation e53x  10. 
SOLUTION We take natural logarithms of both sides of the equation and use (9): 
lne53x   ln 10 
5  3x  ln 10 
3x  5  ln 10x  13 5  ln 10


Since the natural logarithm is found on scientific calculators, we can approximate the 
solution to four decimal places: x  0.8991. 
EXAMPLE 9 Express ln a  21 ln b as a single logarithm. 



SOLUTION Using Laws 3 and 1 of logarithms, we have 
ln a  21 ln b  ln a  ln b12

of the natural logarithm.

Scientific calculators have a key for natural logarithms, so Formula 10 enables us to use 
a calculator to compute a logarithm with any base (as shown in the next example). Similarly, 
Formula 10 allows us to graph any logarithmic function on a graphing calculator or 
computer (see Exercises 43 and 44). 

EXAMPLE 10 Evaluate log85 correct to six decimal places.

EXAMPLE 11 In Example 3 in Section 1.5 we showed that the mass of 90Sr that remains 
from a 24-mg sample after t years is m  f t 24  2t25. Find the inverse of this 
function and interpret it. 

SOLUTION We need to solve the equation m  24  2t25 for t. We start by isolating the 
exponential and taking natural logarithms of both sides: 

2t25  
m

ln2 ln 2 

So the inverse function is 

25 

f 1m ln 24  ln m 

ln 2 

This function gives the time required for the mass to decay to m milligrams. In particular, 
the time required for the mass to be reduced to 5 mg is 

t  f 15

ln 24  ln 556.58 years

This answer agrees with the graphical estimate that we made in Example 3 in 
Section 1.5. 


The graphs of the exponential function y  ex and its inverse function, the natural logarithm 
function, are shown in Figure 13. Because the curve y  ex crosses the y-axis with 
a slope of 1, it follows that the reflected curve y  ln x crosses the x-axis with a slope of 1. 


SECTION 1.6 INVERSE FUNCTIONS AND LOGARITHMS .... 71 

In common with all other logarithmic functions with base greater than 1, the natural 
logarithm is an increasing function defined on 0,  and the y-axis is a vertical asymptote. 
(This means that the values of ln x become very large negative as x approaches 0.) 

EXAMPLE 12 Sketch the graph of the function y  lnx  2  1. 

SOLUTION We start with the graph of y  ln x as given in Figure 13. Using the transformations 
of Section 1.3, we shift it 2 units to the right to get the graph of y  lnx  2 and 
then we shift it 1 unit downward to get the graph of y  lnx  2  1. (See Figure 14.)

Inverse Trigonometric Functions 

When we try to find the inverse trigonometric functions, we have a slight difficulty: 
Because the trigonometric functions are not one-to-one, they don’t have inverse functions. 
The difficulty is overcome by restricting the domains of these functions so that they 
become one-to-one. 

You can see from Figure 17 that the sine function y  sin x is not one-to-one (use the 

Horizontal Line Test). But the function 

f x  sin x, 	2  x  

	2 


(see Figure 18), 

is one-to-one. The inverse function of this restricted sine function f exists and is denoted 
by sin1 or arcsin. It is called the inverse sine function or the arcsine function.

UNDERSTAND 
THE PROBLEM 
1 
PRINCIPLES 
OF PROBLEM 
SOLVING 
2 
THINK OF A PLAN 


There are no hard and fast rules that will ensure success in solving problems. However, it is 
possible to outline some general steps in the problem-solving process and to give some principles 
that may be useful in the solution of certain problems. These steps and principles are 
just common sense made explicit. They have been adapted from George Polya’s book How 
To Solve It. 

The first step is to read the problem and make sure that you understand it clearly. Ask yourself 
the following questions: 

What is the unknown? 
What are the given quantities? 
What are the given conditions? 


For many problems it is useful to 

draw a diagram 

and identify the given and required quantities on the diagram. 
Usually it is necessary to 

introduce suitable notation 

In choosing symbols for the unknown quantities we often use letters such as a, b, c, m, n, x, 
and y, but in some cases it helps to use initials as suggestive symbols; for instance, V for 
volume or t for time. 

Find a connection between the given information and the unknown that will enable you to 
calculate the unknown. It often helps to ask yourself explicitly: “How can I relate the given 
to the unknown?” If you don’t see a connection immediately, the following ideas may be 
helpful in devising a plan. 

Try to Recognize Something Familiar Relate the given situation to previous knowledge. Look at 
the unknown and try to recall a more familiar problem that has a similar unknown. 

Try to Recognize Patterns Some problems are solved by recognizing that some kind of pattern 
is occurring. The pattern could be geometric, or numerical, or algebraic. If you can see regularity 
or repetition in a problem, you might be able to guess what the continuing pattern is 
and then prove it. 

Use Analogy Try to think of an analogous problem, that is, a similar problem, a related 
problem, but one that is easier than the original problem. If you can solve the similar, simpler 
problem, then it might give you the clues you need to solve the original, more difficult 
problem. For instance, if a problem involves very large numbers, you could first try a similar 
problem with smaller numbers. Or if the problem involves three-dimensional geometry, 
you could look for a similar problem in two-dimensional geometry. Or if the problem you 
start with is a general one, you could first try a special case. 

Introduce Something Extra It may sometimes be necessary to introduce something new, an 
auxiliary aid, to help make the connection between the given and the unknown. For instance, 
in a problem where a diagram is useful the auxiliary aid could be a new line drawn in a diagram. 
In a more algebraic problem it could be a new unknown that is related to the original 
unknown. 


Take Cases We may sometimes have to split a problem into several cases and give a different 
argument for each of the cases. For instance, we often have to use this strategy in dealing 
with absolute value. 

Work Backward Sometimes it is useful to imagine that your problem is solved and work 
backward, step by step, until you arrive at the given data. Then you may be able to reverse 
your steps and thereby construct a solution to the original problem. This procedure is commonly 
used in solving equations. For instance, in solving the equation 3x  5  7, we suppose 
that x is a number that satisfies 3x  5  7 and work backward. We add 5 to each side 
of the equation and then divide each side by 3 to get x  4. Since each of these steps can 
be reversed, we have solved the problem. 

Establish Subgoals In a complex problem it is often useful to set subgoals (in which the 
desired situation is only partially fulfilled). If we can first reach these subgoals, then we may 
be able to build on them to reach our final goal. 

Indirect Reasoning Sometimes it is appropriate to attack a problem indirectly. In using proof 
by contradiction to prove that P implies Q, we assume that P is true and Q is false and try 
to see why this can’t happen. Somehow we have to use this information and arrive at a contradiction 
to what we absolutely know is true. 

Mathematical Induction In proving statements that involve a positive integer n, it is frequently 
helpful to use the following principle. 

Principle of Mathematical Induction Let Sn be a statement about the positive integer n. 
Suppose that 

1. S1 is true. 
2. Sk1 is true whenever Sk is true. 
Then Sn is true for all positive integers n. 

This is reasonable because, since is true, it follows from condition 2 (with ) that 
is true. Then, using condition 2 with , we see that is true. Again using condition 2, 
this time with , we have that is true. This procedure can be followed indefinitely. S4k  3 
S3k  2S2 
k  1S1 
3 CARRY OUT THE PLAN In Step 2 a plan was devised. In carrying out that plan we have to check each stage of the 
plan and write the details that prove that each stage is correct. 
4 LOOK BACK Having completed our solution, it is wise to look back over it, partly to see if we have made 
errors in the solution and partly to see if we can think of an easier way to solve the problem. 
Another reason for looking back is that it will familiarize us with the method of solution and 
this may be useful for solving a future problem. Descartes said, “Every problem that I solved 
became a rule which served afterwards to solve other problems.” 
These principles of problem solving are illustrated in the following examples. Before you 
look at the solutions, try to solve these problems yourself, referring to these Principles of 
Problem Solving if you get stuck. You may find it useful to refer to this section from time 
to time as you solve the exercises in the remaining chapters of this book.

EXAMPLE 1 Express the hypotenuse h of a right triangle with area 25 m2 as a function of 

its perimeter P. 
SOLUTION Let’s first sort out the information by identifying the unknown quantity and the 
data: 


Unknown: hypotenuse h 

Given quantities: perimeter P, area 25 m2 
It helps to draw a diagram and we do so in Figure 1. 

h 
b 


a 

In order to connect the given quantities to the unknown, we introduce two extra variables 
a and b, which are the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle. This enables us 
to express the given condition, which is that the triangle is right-angled, by the Pythagorean 
Theorem: 

h2  a2  b2 

The other connections among the variables come by writing expressions for the area and 
perimeter: 

25  12 ab P  a  b  h 

Since P is given, notice that we now have three equations in the three unknowns a, b, 

and :h 
1 h2  a2  b2 
2 25  1 
2 ab 
3P  a  b  h 

Although we have the correct number of equations, they are not easy to solve in a straightforward 
fashion. But if we use the problem-solving strategy of trying to recognize something 
familiar, then we can solve these equations by an easier method. Look at the right 
sides of Equations 1, 2, and 3. Do these expressions remind you of anything familiar? 
Notice that they contain the ingredients of a familiar formula: 

a  b2  a2  2ab  b2 
Using this idea, we express a  b2 in two ways. From Equations 1 and 2 we have 
a  b2  a2  b2   2ab  h2  425 
From Equation 3 we have 

a  b2  P  h2  P2  2Ph  h2 

Thus h2  100  P2  2Ph  h2 
2Ph  P2  100 
P2  100 

h  

2PThis is the required expression for h as a function of P. 


As the next example illustrates, it is often necessary to use the problem-solving principle 
of taking cases when dealing with absolute values.

Combining cases I, II, and III, we see that the inequality is satisfied when 5 x 6. 
So the solution is the interval 5, 6. 

In the following example we first guess the answer by looking at special cases and recognizing 
a pattern. Then we prove it by mathematical induction. 

In using the Principle of Mathematical Induction, we follow three steps: 

STEP 1 Prove that Sn is true when n  1. 
STEP 2 Assume that Sn is true when n  k and deduce that Sn is true when n  k 1. 
STEP 3 Conclude that Sn is true for all n by the Principle of Mathematical Induction.

We notice a pattern: The coefficient of x in the denominator of fnx is n  1 in the 
three cases we have computed. So we make the guess that, in general,

To prove this, we use the Principle of Mathematical Induction. We have already verified 
that (4) is true for n  1. Assume that it is true for n  k, that is,

k  1x  1 k  1x  1 

This expression shows that (4) is true for n  k  1. Therefore, by mathematical induction, 
it is true for all positive integers n.

Limits and Derivatives 
The idea of a limit is 
illustrated by secant lines 
approaching a tangent line. 

In A Preview of Calculus (page 2) we saw how the idea of 
a limit underlies the various branches of calculus. It is therefore 
appropriate to begin our study of calculus by investi


gating limits and their properties. The special type of limit 
that is used to find tangents and velocities gives rise to the 
central idea in differential calculus, the derivative. 

|||| 2.1 The Tangent and Velocity Problems 

In this section we see how limits arise when we attempt to find the tangent to a curve or 
the velocity of an object. 

The Tangent Problem 

The word tangent is derived from the Latin word tangens, which means “touching.” Thus, 
a tangent to a curve is a line that touches the curve. In other words, a tangent line should 
have the same direction as the curve at the point of contact. How can this idea be made

tion is inadequate. Figure l(b) shows two lines l and t passing through a point P on a curve

a tangent. The line , on the other hand, looks like a tangent but it intersects C twice.

FIGURE 1 (a)

To be specific, let’s look at the problem of trying to find a tangent line t to the parabola 
y  x2 in the following example. 

y 
EXAMPLE 1 Find an equation of the tangent line to the parabola y  x2 at the point P1, 1. 

Q{x, ˜} t 
SOLUTION We will be able to find an equation of the tangent line t as soon as we know its 
slope m. The difficulty is that we know only one point, P, on t, whereas we need two 

points to compute the slope. But observe that we can compute an approximation to m by

y=˜ 

P(1, 1) 

choosing a nearby point Qx, x2  on the parabola (as in Figure 2) and computing the 
slope mPQ of the secant line PQ.

We choose x  1 so that Q  P. Then

0.5 1.5 
0.9 1.9 
0.99 1.99

For instance, for the point Q1.5, 2.25 we have 

2.25  1 1.25 
mPQ   2.5 

1.5  1 0.5 
The tables in the margin show the values of mPQ for several values of x close to 1. The 
closer Q is to P, the closer x is to 1 and, it appears from the tables, the closer mPQ is to 2. 
This suggests that the slope of the tangent line t should be m  2. 

We say that the slope of the tangent line is the limit of the slopes of the secant lines, 
and we express this symbolically by writing 

x2  1 

lim mPQ  m and lim  2 

Q lPx l 1 x  1 

Assuming that the slope of the tangent line is indeed 2, we use the point-slope form 
of the equation of a line (see Appendix B) to write the equation of the tangent line 
through 1, 1 as 

y  1  2x  1 or y  2x  1 

Figure 3 illustrates the limiting process that occurs in this example. As Q approaches 
P along the parabola, the corresponding secant lines rotate about P and approach the 
tangent line t.

|||| The physical meaning of the answer in 
Example 2 is that the electric current flowing 
from the capacitor to the flash bulb after 

0.04 second is about –670 microamperes. 
EXAMPLE 2 The flash unit on a camera operates by storing charge on a capacitor and 
releasing it suddenly when the flash is set off. The data at the left describe the charge Q 
remaining on the capacitor (measured in microcoulombs) at time t (measured in seconds 
after the flash goes off ). Use the data to draw the graph of this function and estimate the 
slope of the tangent line at the point where t  0.04. [Note: The slope of the tangent line 
represents the electric current flowing from the capacitor to the flash bulb (measured in 
microamperes).] 

SOLUTION In Figure 4 we plot the given data and use them to sketch a curve that approximates 
the graph of the function.

Given the points P0.04, 67.03 and R0.00, 100.00 on the graph, we find that the 
slope of the secant line PR is 

100.00  67.03 
mPR  824.25 

0.00  0.04 
The table at the left shows the results of similar calculations for the slopes of other 
secant lines. From this table we would expect the slope of the tangent line at t  0.04 to 
lie somewhere between 742 and 607.5. In fact, the average of the slopes of the two 
closest secant lines is 

1 

2 742  607.5  674.75 

So, by this method, we estimate the slope of the tangent line to be 675. 

Another method is to draw an approximation to the tangent line at P and measure the 
sides of the triangle ABC, as in Figure 4. This gives an estimate of the slope of the tangent 
line as

The Velocity Problem 

If you watch the speedometer of a car as you travel in city traffic, you see that the needle 
doesn’t stay still for very long; that is, the velocity of the car is not constant. We assume 
from watching the speedometer that the car has a definite velocity at each moment, but how 
is the “instantaneous” velocity defined? Let’s investigate the example of a falling ball. 


90 .... CHAPTER 2 LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES 

EXAMPLE 3 Suppose that a ball is dropped from the upper observation deck of the CN 
Tower in Toronto, 450 m above the ground. Find the velocity of the ball after 5 seconds. 

SOLUTION Through experiments carried out four centuries ago, Galileo discovered that the 
distance fallen by any freely falling body is proportional to the square of the time it has 
been falling. (This model for free fall neglects air resistance.) If the distance fallen after t 
seconds is denoted by st and measured in meters, then Galileo’s law is expressed by the 
equation 

st  4.9t2 

The difficulty in finding the velocity after 5 s is that we are dealing with a single instant 
of time t  5, so no time interval is involved. However, we can approximate the desired 
quantity by computing the average velocity over the brief time interval of a tenth of a 
second from t  5 to t  5.1: 

distance traveled 

 average velocity  

time elapsed 

s5.1  s5

The CN Tower in Toronto is currently the tallest 

freestanding building in the world. 0.1

4.95.12  4.952 

 49.49 ms 

0.1 
The following table shows the results of similar calculations of the average velocity over 
successively smaller time periods. 


Time interval Average velocity (ms) 
5  t  6 53.9 
5  t  5.1 49.49 
5  t  5.05 49.245 
5  t  5.01 49.049 
5  t  5.001 49.0049 

It appears that as we shorten the time period, the average velocity is becoming closer to 
49 ms. The instantaneous velocity when t  5 is defined to be the limiting value of 
these average velocities over shorter and shorter time periods that start at t  5. Thus, 
the (instantaneous) velocity after 5 s is 

v  49 ms 


You may have the feeling that the calculations used in solving this problem are very 
similar to those used earlier in this section to find tangents. In fact, there is a close connection 
between the tangent problem and the problem of finding velocities. If we draw the 
graph of the distance function of the ball (as in Figure 5) and we consider the points 
Pa, 4.9a2  and Qa  h, 4.9a  h2  on the graph, then the slope of the secant line 
PQ is

which is the same as the average velocity over the time interval a, a  h. Therefore, the 
velocity at time t  a (the limit of these average velocities as h approaches 0) must be 
equal to the slope of the tangent line at P (the limit of the slopes of the secant lines).

Examples 1 and 3 show that in order to solve tangent and velocity problems we must 
be able to find limits. After studying methods for computing limits in the next five sections, 
we will return to the problems of finding tangents and velocities in Section 2.7.

Having seen in the preceding section how limits arise when we want to find the tangent to

Let’s investigate the behavior of the function f defined by f x  x2  x  2 for values 
of x near 2. The following table gives values of f x for values of x close to 2, but not 
equal to 2.

As x approaches 2, 

From the table and the graph of f (a parabola) shown in Figure 1 we see that when x is 
FIGURE 1 close to 2 (on either side of 2), f x is close to 4. In fact, it appears that we can make the 


SECTION 2.2 THE LIMIT OF A FUNCTION .... 93 

values of f x as close as we like to 4 by taking x sufficiently close to 2. We express this 
by saying “the limit of the function f x  x2  x  2 as x approaches 2 is equal to 4.” 
The notation for this is 

lim  x2  x  2  4 

x l2 

In general, we use the following notation. 

Definition We write 
and say “the limit of , as approaches , equals ” 
if we can make the values of arbitrarily close to (as close to L as we like) 
by taking x to be sufficiently close to (on either side of ) but not equal to .aaa 
Lf x 
Laxf x 
lim 
x l a 
f x  L

Roughly speaking, this says that the values of f x get closer and closer to the number 

L as x gets closer and closer to the number a (from either side of a) but x  a. A more pre


cise definition will be given in Section 2.4. 

An alternative notation for 
lim f x  L 

x l a 

is f x l L as x l a 

which is usually read “ f x approaches L as x approaches a.” 

Notice the phrase “but x  a” in the definition of limit. This means that in finding the 

limit of f x as x approaches a, we never consider x  a. In fact, f x need not even be 

defined when x  a. The only thing that matters is how f is defined near a. 

Figure 2 shows the graphs of three functions. Note that in part (c), f a is not defined 

and in part (b), f a  L. But in each case, regardless of what happens at a, it is true that 

limx l af x  L.

On the basis of the values in the tables, we make the guess that 

x  1 

lim  0.5

Example 1 is illustrated by the graph of f in Figure 3. Now let’s change f slightly by

SECTION 2.2 THE LIMIT OF A FUNCTION .... 95 

If you try these calculations on your own calculator you might get different values, but 
eventually you will get the value 0 if you make t sufficiently small. Does this mean that 

11

the answer is really 0 instead of ? No, the value of the limit is , as we will show in the 

66

| next section. The problem is that the calculator gave false values because st2  9 is very 
close to 3 when t is small. (In fact, when t is sufficiently small, a calculator’s value for 
st2  9 is 3.000... to as many digits as the calculator is capable of carrying.) 
Something similar happens when we try to graph the function 

st2  9  3

of Example 2 on a graphing calculator or computer. Parts (a) and (b) of Figure 5 show quite 
accurate graphs of f , and when we use the trace mode (if available) we can estimate easily 
that the limit is about 61. But if we zoom in too far, as in parts (c) and (d), then we get 
inaccurate graphs, again because of problems with subtraction.

(and remembering that, if x  , sin x means the sine of the angle whose radian measure 
is x), we construct the following table of values correct to eight decimal places. 

From the table and the graph in Figure 6 we guess that

Computer algebra systems (CAS) have commands

they don’t find limits by numerical experimentation. 
Instead, they use more sophisticated

| Examples 4 and 5 illustrate some of the pitfalls in guessing the value of a limit. It is 
easy to guess the wrong value if we use inappropriate values of x, but it is difficult to know 
when to stop calculating values. And, as the discussion after Example 2 shows, sometimes 
calculators and computers give the wrong values. In the next two sections, however, we 
will develop foolproof methods for calculating limits.

[This function is named after the electrical engineer Oliver Heaviside (1850–1925) and 
can be used to describe an electric current that is switched on at time t  0.] Its graph is 

FIGURE 8 shown in Figure 8. 
As t approaches 0 from the left, Ht approaches 0. As t approaches 0 from the right, 
Ht approaches 1. There is no single number that Ht approaches as t approaches 0. 
Therefore, limt l 0 Ht does not exist. 

One-Sided Limits 

We noticed in Example 6 that Ht approaches 0 as t approaches 0 from the left and Ht 
approaches 1 as t approaches 0 from the right. We indicate this situation symbolically by 
writing 

lim Ht  0 and lim Ht  1 

t l 0 t l 0 

The symbol “t l 0” indicates that we consider only values of t that are less than 0. 
Likewise, “t l 0” indicates that we consider only values of t that are greater than 0.

Definition We write 
lim f x  L 

x l a 

and say the left-hand limit of f x as x approaches a [or the limit of f x as x 
approaches a from the left] is equal to L if we can make the values of f x arbitrarily 
close to L by taking x to be sufficiently close to a and x less than a. 

Notice that Definition 2 differs from Definition 1 only in that we require x to be less 
than a. Similarly, if we require that x be greater than a, we get “the right-hand limit of 
f x as x approaches a is equal to L” and we write 

lim f x  L 

x l a 


98 .... CHAPTER 2 LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES 

Thus, the symbol “x l a” means that we consider only x  a. These definitions are illustrated 
in Figure 9.

from the left, but they approach 1 as x approaches 2 from the right. Therefore 

FIGURE 10 (a) lim tx  3 and (b) lim tx  1

(c) Since the left and right limits are different, we conclude from (3) that limx l 2 tx

The graph also shows that

SOLUTION If x is close to 3 but larger than 3, then the denominator x  3 is a small positive

Thus, intuitively we see that

Likewise, if x is close to 3 but smaller than 3, then x  3 is a small negative number but

SOLUTION Because

cos x 
there are potential vertical asymptotes where cos x  0. In fact, since cos x l 0 as

cos x l 0 

as

, we have

This shows that the line 

x 

is a vertical asymptote. Similar reasoning shows 

FIGURE 16 

that the lines

, where n is an integer, are all vertical asymptotes of 

y=tan x f x  tan x. The graph in Figure 16 confirms this. 


Another example of a function whose graph has a vertical asymptote is the natural logarithmic 
function y  ln x. From Figure 17 we see that 

lim ln x  

and so the line x  0 (the y-axis) is a vertical asymptote. In fact, the same is true for

|||| 2.3 Calculating Limits Using the Limit Laws 

In Section 2.2 we used calculators and graphs to guess the values of limits, but we saw that 
such methods don’t always lead to the correct answer. In this section we use the following 
properties of limits, called the Limit Laws, to calculate limits. 

Limit Laws Suppose that c is a constant and the limits 
lim f x and lim tx

exist. Then

SECTION 2.3 CALCULATING LIMITS USING THE LIMIT LAWS .... 105 

These five laws can be stated verbally as follows: 

1. The limit of a sum is the sum of the limits. 
2. The limit of a difference is the difference of the limits. 
3. 
The limit of a constant times a function is the constant times the limit of the 
function. 
4. The limit of a product is the product of the limits. 
5. 
The limit of a quotient is the quotient of the limits (provided that the limit of the 
denominator is not 0). 
It is easy to believe that these properties are true. For instance, if f x is close to L and 
tx is close to M, it is reasonable to conclude that f x  tx is close to L  M. This gives 
us an intuitive basis for believing that Law 1 is true. In Section 2.4 we give a precise definition 
of a limit and use it to prove this law. The proofs of the remaining laws are given 
in Appendix F. 

EXAMPLE 1 Use the Limit Laws and the graphs of f and t in Figure 1 to evaluate the 
following limits, if they exist. 

f x 

(a) lim  f x  5tx	 (b) lim  f xtx	 (c) lim 
x l 2 
x l 1 x l 2 tx 

SOLUTION 

(a) From the graphs of f and t we see that 
lim f x  1 and lim tx  1 

x l 2 
x l 2 

Therefore, we have 

lim  f x  5tx	  lim f x  lim 5tx	 (by Law 1) 

x l 2 
x l 2 x l 2 

 lim f x  5 lim tx (by Law 3) 

x l 2 x l 2 

 1  51  4 

(b) We see that limx l 1 f x  2. But limx l 1 tx does not exist because the left and 
right limits are different: 
lim tx  2 lim tx  1 

x l 1. 
x l 1 

So we can’t use Law 4. The given limit does not exist, since the left limit is not equal to 
the right limit. 

(c) The graphs show that 
lim f x
 1.4 and lim tx  0 
x l 2 
x l 2 

Because the limit of the denominator is 0, we can’t use Law 5. The given limit does not 
exist because the denominator approaches 0 while the numerator approaches a nonzero 
number. 


If we use the Product Law repeatedly with tx  f x, we obtain the following law.

106 .... CHAPTER 2 LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES 

In applying these six limit laws, we need to use two special limits: 

7. lim c  c 8. lim x  a 
x l ax l a 

These limits are obvious from an intuitive point of view (state them in words or draw 
graphs of y  c and y  x), but proofs based on the precise definition are requested in the 
exercises for Section 2.4. 

If we now put f x  x in Law 6 and use Law 8, we get another useful special limit. 

9. lim xn  an where n is a positive integer 
x l a 

A similar limit holds for roots as follows. (For square roots the proof is outlined in Exercise 
37 in Section 2.4.)

see that the limits of the numerator and denominator exist and the limit of the denominator 
is not 0. 

|||| NEWTON AND LIMITS 

Isaac Newton was born on Christmas Day in 
1642, the year of Galileo’s death. When he 
entered Cambridge University in 1661 Newton 
didn’t know much mathematics, but he learned 
quickly by reading Euclid and Descartes and 
by attending the lectures of Isaac Barrow. 
Cambridge was closed because of the plague in 
1665 and 1666, and Newton returned home to 
reflect on what he had learned. Those two years 
were amazingly productive for at that time he 
made four of his major discoveries: (1) his 
representation of functions as sums of infinite 
series, including the binomial theorem; (2) his 
work on differential and integral calculus; (3) his 
laws of motion and law of universal gravitation; 
and (4) his prism experiments on the nature of 
light and color. Because of a fear of controversy 
and criticism, he was reluctant to publish his discoveries 
and it wasn’t until 1687, at the urging of 
the astronomer Halley, that Newton published 
Principia Mathematica. In this work, the greatest 
scientific treatise ever written, Newton set forth 
his version of calculus and used it to investigate 
mechanics, fluid dynamics, and wave motion, 
and to explain the motion of planets and comets. 

The beginnings of calculus are found in the 
calculations of areas and volumes by ancient 
Greek scholars such as Eudoxus and Archimedes. 
Although aspects of the idea of a limit are 
implicit in their “method of exhaustion,” Eudoxus 
and Archimedes never explicitly formulated the 
concept of a limit. Likewise, mathematicians 
such as Cavalieri, Fermat, and Barrow, the immediate 
precursors of Newton in the development 
of calculus, did not actually use limits. It was 
Isaac Newton who was the first to talk explicitly 
about limits. He explained that the main idea 
behind limits is that quantities “approach nearer 
than by any given difference.” Newton stated 
that the limit was the basic concept in calculus, 
but it was left to later mathematicians like 
Cauchy to clarify his ideas about limits.

NOTE If we let f x  2x2  3x  4, then f 5  39. In other words, we would have 
gotten the correct answer in Example 2(a) by substituting 5 for x. Similarly, direct substitution 
provides the correct answer in part (b). The functions in Example 2 are a polynomial 
and a rational function, respectively, and similar use of the Limit Laws proves that 
direct substitution always works for such functions (see Exercises 53 and 54). We state this 
fact as follows. 

Direct Substitution Property If f is a polynomial or a rational function and a is in the 
domain of f , then 

lim f x  f a 

x l a 

Functions with the Direct Substitution Property are called continuous at a and will be 
studied in Section 2.5. However, not all limits can be evaluated by direct substitution, as 
the following examples show. 

x2  1 

EXAMPLE 3 Find lim . 

x l 1 x  1 

SOLUTION Let f x  x2  1x  1. We can’t find the limit by substituting x  1 
because f 1 isn’t defined. Nor can we apply the Quotient Law because the limit of the 
denominator is 0. Instead, we need to do some preliminary algebra. We factor the numerator 
as a difference of squares: 

x2  1 x  1x  1 

x  1 x  1 

The numerator and denominator have a common factor of x  1. When we take the limit 
as x approaches 1, we have x  1 and so x  1  0. Therefore, we can cancel the common 
factor and compute the limit as follows: 

x2  1 x  1x  1 

lim  lim 

x l 1 x  1 x l 1 x  1 

 lim x  1

x l 1 

 1  1  2 

The limit in this example arose in Section 2.1 when we were trying to find the tangent to 
the parabola y  x2 at the point 1, 1.

NOTE In Example 3 we were able to compute the limit by replacing the given func


tion f x  x2  1 x  1 by a simpler function, tx  x  1, with the same limit. 

This is valid because f x  tx except when x  1, and in computing a limit as x 

approaches 1 we don’t consider what happens when x is actually equal to 1. In general, 

if f  x  tx when x  a, then

SOLUTION 

Here t is defined at x  1 and t1  

, but the value of a limit as x 
tx  x  1 

for

approaches 1 does not depend on the value of the function at 1. Since 

x  1, we have 
lim tx  lim x  1  2 

x l 1 x l 1 


Note that the values of the functions in Examples 3 and 4 are identical except when 
x  1 (see Figure 2) and so they have the same limit as x approaches 1.

SECTION 2.3 CALCULATING LIMITS USING THE LIMIT LAWS .... 109 

Some limits are best calculated by first finding the left- and right-hand limits. The following 
theorem is a reminder of what we discovered in Section 2.2. It says that a two-sided 
limit exists if and only if both of the one-sided limits exist and are equal. 

1 
Theorem lim f x  L if and only if lim f x  L  lim f x 

x l ax l a x l a 

When computing one-sided limits, we use the fact that the Limit Laws also hold for 
one-sided limits. 

EXAMPLE 7 Show that lim  x   0. 

x l 0 

SOLUTION Recall that 
if x  0

 x   x 

x if x  0 
Since  x   x for x  0, we have 
lim  x   lim x  0 

x l 0 x l 0 

For x  0 we have  x   x and so 
lim  x   lim x  0 

x l 0 x l 0 

Therefore, by Theorem 1, 
lim  x   0

limx l 0  x xdoes not exist. The graph of the function f x   x x is shown in 
Figure 4 and supports the one-sided limits that we found.

Since x  2 for 2  x  3, we have

|||| 2.4 The Precise Definition of a Limit 

The intuitive definition of a limit given in Section 2.2 is inadequate for some purposes 
because such phrases as “x is close to 2” and “ f x gets closer and closer to L” are vague. 

In order to be able to prove conclusively that 
lim 
x l 0 x3  
cos 5x 
10,000   0.0001 or lim 
x l 0 
sin x 
x 
 1 

we must make the definition of a limit precise. 
To motivate the precise definition of a limit, let’s consider the function 

if x  3 

f x  2x  1 
6 if x  3 

Intuitively, it is clear that when x is close to 3 but x  3, then f x is close to 5, and so 
limx l3 f  x  5. 
To obtain more detailed information about how f x varies when x is close to 3, we ask 
the following question: 

How close to 3 does x have to be so that f x differs from 5 by less than 0.l? 

The distance from x to 3 is  x  3  and the distance from f x to 5 is  f x  5 , so our 

|||| It is traditional to use the Greek letter 
(delta) in this situation. 

problem is to find a number 

such that 

 f  x  5   0.1 if  x  3  

but x  3 

If  x  3   0, then x  3, so an equivalent formulation of our problem is to find a num


ber 

such that 

 f x  5   0.1if 0   x  3   

Notice that if 0   x  3   0.12  0.05, then 

 f x  5   2x  1  5    2x  6   2 x  3   0.1 
that is,  f x  5   0.1if 0   x  3   0.05 

Thus, an answer to the problem is given by 

 0.05; that is, if x is within a distance of 
0.05 from 3, then f x will be within a distance of 0.1 from 5. 
If we change the number 0.l in our problem to the smaller number 0.01, then by using 
the same method we find that f  x will differ from 5 by less than 0.01 provided that x differs 
from 3 by less than (0.01)2  0.005: 

 f x  5   0.01 if 0   x  3   0.005 
Similarly, 
 f x  5   0.001 if 0   x  3   0.0005 

The numbers 0.1, 0.01, and 0.001 that we have considered are error tolerances that we 
might allow. For 5 to be the precise limit of f x as x approaches 3, we must not only be 
able to bring the difference between f x and 5 below each of these three numbers; we 


SECTION 2.4 THE PRECISE DEFINITION OF A LIMIT .... 115 

must be able to bring it below any positive number. And, by the same reasoning, we can! 
If we write (the Greek letter epsilon) for an arbitrary positive number, then we find as 
before that 
is close to 3 because (1) says 
from 5 by taking the val) 
to lie in the interval

Since  x a  is the distance from x to a and  f x L  is the distance from f x to L, 
and since 
can be arbitrarily small, the definition of a limit can be expressed in words 
as follows: 

limx l af x  L means that the distance between f x and L can be made arbitrarily small 
by taking the distance from x to a sufficiently small (but not 0). 

Alternatively, 

limx l af x  L means that the values of f x can be made as close as we please to L 
by taking x close enough to a (but not equal to a). 


We can also reformulate Definition 2 in terms of intervals by observing that the in


equality  x a  

is equivalent to 

x a 

	, which in turn can be written 
Also 0  x a  is true if and only if x a  0, that is,

as 

f x L

. Similarly, the inequality 

is equivalent to the pair of inequalities 

x  a 

L 
 f x L 
. Therefore, in terms of intervals, Definition 2 can be stated 
as follows: 

limx l af x  L means that for every 
0 (no matter how small 
is) we can find 

0 such that if x lies in the open interval 
a 

	, a 

and , then

x  a 

f x 

lies in 

the open interval L 
, L 
.

We interpret this statement geometrically by representing a function by an arrow diagram 
as in Figure 2, where f maps a subset of  onto another subset of .

The definition of limit says that if any small interval L 
, L 
 is given around L, 

a 

	, a 

then we can find an interval 

around such that f maps all the points in

(except possibly ) into the interval L 

Another geometric interpretation of limits can be given in terms of the graph of a function. 
If

the graph of (see Figure 4). If limx l af x  L, then we can find a number

if such a 

has been found, then any smaller 

will also work.

In other words, find a number

SECTION 2.4 THE PRECISE DEFINITION OF A LIMIT ....

SOLUTION A graph of f is shown in Figure 7; we are interested in the region near the point 
1, 2. Notice that we can rewrite the inequality 

x3 5x 6 2  0.2 

3 as 
1.8 x3 5x 6 2.2 

So we need to determine the values of x for which the curve y  x3 5x 6 lies 
between the horizontal lines y  1.8 and y  2.2. Therefore, we graph the curves 

FIGURE 7 
y  x3 5x 6, y  1.8, and y  2.2 near the point 1, 2 in Figure 8. Then we use 
the cursor to estimate that the x-coordinate of the point of intersection of the line

2.3 

_5 
_3 
y  2.2 and the curve y  x3 5x 6 is about 0.911. Similarly, y  x3 5x 6 
intersects the line y  1.8 when x  1.124. So, rounding to be safe, we can say that 

1.8 x3 5x 6 2.2 whenever 0.92 x 1.12 
This interval 0.92, 1.12 is not symmetric about x  1. The distance from x  1 to the 
y=.-5x+6 
y=2.2 
y=1.8 
(1, 2) 
0.8 
1.2 left endpoint is 1 0.92  0.08 and the distance to the right endpoint is 0.12. We can 
1.7 

choose 

to be the smaller of these numbers, that is, 

 0.08. Then we can rewrite our 
inequalities in terms of distances as follows: 

FIGURE 8 

x3 5x 6 2  0.2 whenever  x 1  0.08 

This just says that by keeping x within 0.08 of 1, we are able to keep f x within 0.2 
of 2. 

Although we chose 

 0.08, any smaller positive value of 
would also have 

worked. 
The graphical procedure in Example 1 gives an illustration of the definition for 
 0.2, 



but it does not prove that the limit is equal to 2. A proof has to provide a 

for every 
. 

In proving limit statements it may be helpful to think of the definition of limit as a challenge. 
First it challenges you with a number 
. Then you must be able to produce a suit


able 

	. You have to be able to do this for every 

0, not just a particular 
. 

Imagine a contest between two people, A and B, and imagine yourself to be B. Person 
A stipulates that the fixed number L should be approximated by the values of f x to within 

a degree of accuracy (say, 0.01). Person B then responds by finding a number 

such that 

 f x L  whenever 0  x a  

	. Then A may become more exacting and 
challenge B with a smaller value of 
(say, 0.0001). Again B has to respond by finding a 

corresponding 

	. Usually the smaller the value of 

, the smaller the corresponding value 
of 

must be. If B always wins, no matter how small A makes 
, then limx l a 

f x  L.

Note that in the solution of Example 2 there were two stages—guessing and proving. 



We made a preliminary analysis that enabled us to guess a value for 

	. But then in the second 
stage we had to go back and prove in a careful, logical fashion that we had made a 
correct guess. This procedure is typical of much of mathematics. Sometimes it is necessary 
to first make an intelligent guess about the answer to a problem and then prove that 
the guess is correct.

reformulated as follows.

We can find such a number C if we restrict x to lie in some interval centered at 3.

120 .... CHAPTER 2 LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES 

As Example 4 shows, it is not always easy to prove that limit statements are true 

using the 

, 


definition. In fact, if we had been given a more complicated function such 

as f x  6x2 8x 9	2x2 1, a proof would require a great deal of ingenuity. 
Fortunately this is unnecessary because the Limit Laws stated in Section 2.3 can be proved 
using Definition 2, and then the limits of complicated functions can be found rigorously 
from the Limit Laws without resorting to the definition directly. 

For instance, we prove the Sum Law: If limx l af x  L and limx l a tx  M both 
exist, then 

lim  f x tx  L M

|||| As illustrated in Figure 1, if f is continuous, 
then the points x, f x on the graph of f 
approach the point a, f a on the graph. So 
there is no gap in the curve.

FIGURE 2 

We noticed in Section 2.3 that the limit of a function as x approaches a can often be found 
simply by calculating the value of the function at a. Functions with this property are called 
continuous at a. We will see that the mathematical definition of continuity corresponds 
closely with the meaning of the word continuity in everyday language. (A continuous 
process is one that takes place gradually, without interruption or abrupt change.) 

1 
Definition A function f is continuous at a number a if 
lim f x  f a 

x la 

Notice that Definition l implicitly requires three things if f is continuous at a: 

1. f a is defined (that is, a is in the domain of f ) 
2. lim f x exists 
x la 

3. lim f x  f a 
x la 

The definition says that f is continuous at a if f x approaches f a as x approaches a. 
Thus, a continuous function f has the property that a small change in x produces only a 
small change in f x. In fact, the change in f x can be kept as small as we please by keeping 
the change in x sufficiently small. 

If f is defined near a (in other words, f is defined on an open interval containing a, 
except perhaps at a), we say that f is discontinuous at a, or f has a discontinuity at , if 

a 

f is not continuous at a. 

Physical phenomena are usually continuous. For instance, the displacement or velocity 
of a vehicle varies continuously with time, as does a person’s height. But discontinuities 
do occur in such situations as electric currents. [See Example 6 in Section 2.2, where the 
Heaviside function is discontinuous at 0 because limt l 0 Ht does not exist.] 

Geometrically, you can think of a function that is continuous at every number in an 
interval as a function whose graph has no break in it. The graph can be drawn without 
removing your pen from the paper. 

EXAMPLE 1 Figure 2 shows the graph of a function f. At which numbers is f discontinuous? 
Why? 

SOLUTION It looks as if there is a discontinuity when a  1 because the graph has a break 
there. The official reason that f is discontinuous at 1 is that f 1 is not defined. 

The graph also has a break when a  3, but the reason for the discontinuity is different. 
Here, f 3 is defined, but limx l3 f x does not exist (because the left and right limits 
are different). So f is discontinuous at 3. 

What about a  5? Here, f 5 is defined and limx l5 f x exists (because the left and 
right limits are the same). But 
lim f x  f 5 

x l 5 

So f is discontinuous at 5. 


SECTION 2.5 CONTINUITY .... 125 

Now let’s see how to detect discontinuities when a function is defined by a formula.

(c) f x  x  2 (d) f x  x 
1 if x  2 


SOLUTION 

(a) Notice that f 2 is not defined, so f is discontinuous at 2. Later we’ll see why f is 
continuous at all other numbers. 
(b) Here f 0  1 is defined but 
1 
lim f x  lim 2 

x l 0 x l 0 x

does not exist. (See Example 8 in Section 2.2.) So f is discontinuous at 0. 

(c) Here f 2  1 is defined and 
x2  x  2 x  2x  1 

lim f x  lim  lim  lim x  1  3 

x l2 x l2 x  2 x l2 x  2 x l2 

exists. But 
lim f x  f 2 

x l2 

so f is not continuous at 2. 

(d) The greatest integer function f x  x has discontinuities at all of the integers 
because limx ln x does not exist if n is an integer. (See Example 10 and Exercise 49 in 
Section 2.3.) 
Figure 3 shows the graphs of the functions in Example 2. In each case the graph can’t 
be drawn without lifting the pen from the paper because a hole or break or jump occurs in 
the graph. The kind of discontinuity illustrated in parts (a) and (c) is called removable 
because we could remove the discontinuity by redefining f at just the single number 2. 
[The function tx  x  1 is continuous.] The discontinuity in part (b) is called an infinite 
discontinuity. The discontinuities in part (d) are called jump discontinuities because 
the function “jumps” from one value to another.

Definition A function f is continuous on an interval if it is continuous at 
every number in the interval. (If f is defined only on one side of an endpoint of the 
interval, we understand continuous at the endpoint to mean continuous from the 
right or continuous from the left.) 
EXAMPLE 4 Show that the function f x  1  s1  x2 is continuous on the 
interval 1, 1.

Proof Each of the five parts of this theorem follows from the corresponding Limit Law 
in Section 2.3. For instance, we give the proof of part 1. Since f and t are continuous at 
a, we have 

lim fx  fa and lim tx  ta 

xl axl a 

Therefore 

lim  f tx  lim  fx tx

 lim fx  lim tx(by Law 1) 

xl axl a 

 fa ta 
  f ta 

This shows that f t is continuous at a. 


It follows from Theorem 4 and Definition 3 that if f and t are continuous on an interval, 
then so are the functions f t, f t, cf, ft, and (if t is never 0) f	t. The following 
theorem was stated in Section 2.3 as the Direct Substitution Property. 

Theorem 
(a) Any polynomial is continuous everywhere; that is, it is continuous on 
. 
(b) Any rational function is continuous wherever it is defined; that is, it is continuous 
on its domain. 
  	, 	 
5 
Proof 

(a) A polynomial is a function of the form 
Px  cnxn cn1xn1 c1x c0 
where c0, c1, ..., cn are constants. We know that 
lim c0  c0 (by Law 7) 

xl a 

and lim xm  am m  1, 2, ..., n (by 9) 

xl a 

m

This equation is precisely the statement that the function fx  xis a continuous 

m

function. Thus, by part 3 of Theorem 4, the function tx  cxis continuous. Since P 
is a sum of functions of this form and a constant function, it follows from part 1 of 
Theorem 4 that P is continuous. 


128 .... CHAPTER 2 LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES 

(b) A rational function is a function of the form 
Px 

f x  

Qx 

where P and Q are polynomials. The domain of f is D  x    Qx  0. We know 
from part (a) that P and Q are continuous everywhere. Thus, by part 5 of Theorem 4, 
f is continuous at every number in D. 


As an illustration of Theorem 5, observe that the volume of a sphere varies continuously 

with its radius because the formula 

Vr  43 


r

3 

shows that V is a polynomial function 

of r. Likewise, if a ball is thrown vertically into the air with a velocity of 50 ft	s, then the 
height of the ball in feet after t seconds is given by the formula h  50t  16t2. Again this 
is a polynomial function, so the height is a continuous function of the elapsed time. 

Knowledge of which functions are continuous enables us to evaluate some limits very 
quickly, as the following example shows. Compare it with Example 2(b) in Section 2.3.

SOLUTION The function

x3  2x2  1

is rational, so by Theorem 5 it is continuous on its domain, which is {x  x  53}. 
Therefore

It turns out that most of the familiar functions are continuous at every number in their 
domains. For instance, Limit Law 10 (page 106) implies that root functions are continuous. 
[Example 3 in Section 2.4 shows that f x  sx is continuous from the right at 0.] 

From the appearance of the graphs of the sine and cosine functions (Figure 18 in 
Section 1.2), we would certainly guess that they are continuous. We know from the defin

|||| The inverse trigonometric functions are The inverse function of any continuous function is also continuous. (The graph of 
reviewed in Section 1.6. 

is obtained by reflecting the graph of f about the line y  x. So if the graph of f has no 
f 1

break in it, neither does the graph of .) Thus, the inverse trigonometric functions are 
continuous. 

In Section 1.5 we defined the exponential function y  ax so as to fill in the holes in the 
graph of y  ax where x is rational. In other words, the very definition of y  ax makes 
it a continuous function on . Therefore, its inverse function y  logax is continuous 
on 0, 	.

Theorem The following types of functions are continuous at every number in 

their domains: 

polynomials rational functions root functions 

trigonometric functions inverse trigonometric functions 

exponential functions logarithmic functions 

ln x  tan1x 

EXAMPLE 6 Where is the function f x  continuous? 

x2  1 

SOLUTION We know from Theorem 7 that the function y  ln x is continuous for x  0 
and y  tan1x is continuous on . Thus, by part 1 of Theorem 4, y  ln x  tan1x is 
continuous on 0, 	. The denominator, y  x2  1, is a polynomial, so it is continuous 
everywhere. Therefore, by part 5 of Theorem 4, f is continuous at all positive numbers x 
except where x2  1  0. So f is continuous on the intervals 0, 1 and 1, 	. 


Another way of combining continuous functions f and t to get a new continuous function 
is to form the composite function f  t. This fact is a consequence of the following 
theorem.

Intuitively, Theorem 8 is reasonable because if x is close to a, then tx is close to b, 
and since f is continuous at b, if tx is close to b, then f tx is close to f b. A proof 
of Theorem 8 is given in Appendix F.

Theorem If t is continuous at a and f is continuous at ta, then the composite 
function f  t given by  f  tx  f tx is continuous at a. 
This theorem is often expressed informally by saying “a continuous function of a continuous 
function is a continuous function.” 
Proof Since t is continuous at a, we have 
lim tx  ta 

x l a 

Since f is continuous at b  ta. 
, we can apply Theorem 8 to obtain 
lim f tx  f ta 

x l a 

which is precisely the statement that the function hx  f tx is continuous at a; that 
is, f  t is continuous at a.

EXAMPLE 8 Where are the following functions continuous? 

(a) hx  sinx2 . 
(b) Fx  ln1  cos x 
SOLUTION 

(a) We have hx  f tx, where 
tx  x2 and f x  sin x 

Now t is continuous on  since it is a polynomial, and f is also continuous everywhere. 
Thus, h  f  t is continuous on  by Theorem 9. 

_10

(b) We know from Theorem 7 that f x  ln x is continuous and tx  1  cos x 
is continuous (because both y  1 and y  cos x are continuous). Therefore, by 
Theorem 9, Fx  f tx is continuous wherever it is defined. Now ln1  cos x is 
defined when 1  cos x  0. So it is undefined when cos x  1, and this happens

when

FIGURE 7 

y=ln(1+cos x) An important property of continuous functions is expressed by the following theorem, 
whose proof is found in more advanced books on calculus. 

The Intermediate Value Theorem Suppose that is continuous on the closed interval

The Intermediate Value Theorem states that a continuous function takes on every intermediate 
value between the function values f a and f b. It is illustrated by Figure 8. Note 
that the value N can be taken on once [as in part (a)] or more than once [as in part (b)].

then it is easy to believe that the Intermediate Value Theorem is true. In geometric terms it 
says that if any horizontal line y  N is given between y  f a and y  f b as in Figure 
9, then the graph of f can’t jump over the line. It must intersect y  N somewhere. 

It is important that the function f in Theorem 10 be continuous. The Intermediate Value 
Theorem is not true in general for discontinuous functions (see Exercise 44). 

One use of the Intermediate Value Theorem is in locating roots of equations as in the 

FIGURE 9 
following example. 


132 .... CHAPTER 2 LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES 

EXAMPLE 9 Show that there is a root of the equation 

4x3  6x2  3x  2  0 

between 1 and 2. 

SOLUTION Let f x  4x3  6x2  3x  2. We are looking for a solution of the given 
equation, that is, a number c between 1 and 2 such that f c  0. Therefore, we take 
a  1, b  2, and N  0 in Theorem 10. We have 

f 1  4  6  3  2  1  0 

and f 2  32  24  6  2  12  0 

Thus, f 1  0  f 2; that is, N  0 is a number between f 1 and f 2. Now f is 
continuous since it is a polynomial, so the Intermediate Value Theorem says there 
is a number c between 1 and 2 such that f c  0. In other words, the equation 
4x3  6x2  3x  2  0 has at least one root c in the interval 1, 2. 

In fact, we can locate a root more precisely by using the Intermediate Value Theorem 
again. Since 

f 1.2  0.128  0 and f 1.3  0.548  0 

a root must lie between 1.2 and 1.3. A calculator gives, by trial and error, 

f 1.22  0.007008  0 and f 1.23  0.056068  0 

so a root lies in the interval 1.22, 1.23. 


We can use a graphing calculator or computer to illustrate the use of the Intermediate 
Value Theorem in Example 9. Figure 10 shows the graph of f in the viewing rectangle 
1, 3 by 3, 3 and you can see that the graph crosses the x-axis between 1 and 2. Figure 
11 shows the result of zooming in to the viewing rectangle 1.2, 1.3 by 0.2, 0.2.

In fact, the Intermediate Value Theorem plays a role in the very way these graphing 
devices work. A computer calculates a finite number of points on the graph and turns on 
the pixels that contain these calculated points. It assumes that the function is continuous 
and takes on all the intermediate values between two consecutive points. The computer 
therefore connects the pixels by turning on the intermediate pixels.

As x grows larger and larger you can see that the values of f x get closer and closer

x sufficiently large. This situation is expressed symbolically by writing

lim f x  L

to indicate that the values of f x become closer and closer to L as x becomes larger and 
larger.

Another notation for limx l  f x  L is 

f x l L as x l  
The symbol  does not represent a number. Nonetheless, the expression lim f x  L is 
often read as x l 

“the limit of f x, as x approaches infinity, is L” 
or “the limit of f x, as x becomes infinite, is L” 
or “the limit of f x, as x increases without bound, is L” 

The meaning of such phrases is given by Definition 1. A more precise definition, similar 

to the 

, 


definition of Section 2.4, is given at the end of this section. 

Geometric illustrations of Definition 1 are shown in Figure 2. Notice that there are 

many ways for the graph of f to approach the line y  L (which is called a horizontal 

asymptote) as we look to the far right of each graph.

Referring back to Figure 1, we see that for numerically large negative values of x, the 

values of f x are close to 1. By letting x decrease through negative values without bound, 

we can make f x as close as we like to 1. This is expressed by writing 

x2  1 

lim  1 

x l x2  1 

The general definition is as follows.

is often read as 
“the limit of f x, as x approaches negative infinity, is L”

For instance, the curve illustrated in Figure 1 has the line y  1 as a horizontal asymptote 
because 

An example of a curve with two horizontal asymptotes is y  tan1x. (See Figure 4.)

so both of the lines

and

are horizontal asymptotes. (This follows from 

the fact that the lines

are vertical asymptotes of the graph of tan.)

SOLUTION We see that the values of f x become large as x l 1 from both sides, so 
lim f x  

Notice that f x becomes large negative as x approaches 2 from the left, but large positive 
as x approaches 2 from the right. So 

lim f x   and lim f x   

x l2 x l2 

Thus, both of the lines x  1 and x  2 are vertical asymptotes. 

FIGURE 5 

As x becomes large, it appears that f x approaches 4. But as x decreases through 
negative values, f x approaches 2. So 

lim f x  4 and lim f x  2 

x l  x l 

This means that both y  4 and y  2 are horizontal asymptotes.

100 10,000 1,000,000 

In fact, by taking x large enough, we can make 1x as close to 0 as we please. Therefore, 
according to Definition 1, we have 

1 

lim  0 

x l  x 

Similar reasoning shows that when x is large negative, 1x is small negative, so we also 
have 

1 

lim  0 

x l x 

It follows that the line y  0 (the x-axis) is a horizontal asymptote of the curve y  1x. 
(This is an equilateral hyperbola; see Figure 6.) 


Most of the Limit Laws that were given in Section 2.3 also hold for limits at infinity. It 
can be proved that the Limit Laws listed in Section 2.3 (with the exception of Laws 9 and 
10) are also valid if “ x l a” is replaced by “x l ” or “ x l .” In particular, if we 
combine Laws 6 and 11 with the results of Example 2, we obtain the following important 
rule for calculating limits.

SOLUTION As x becomes large, both numerator and denominator become large, so it isn’t 
obvious what happens to their ratio. We need to do some preliminary algebra. 

To evaluate the limit at infinity of any rational function, we first divide both the 
numerator and denominator by the highest power of x that occurs in the denominator. 
(We may assume that x  0, since we are interested only in large values of x.) In this 
case the highest power of x in the denominator is x2, so we have

A similar calculation shows that the limit as x l  is also 53 . Figure 7 illustrates the 
results of these calculations by showing how the graph of the given rational function 
approaches the horizontal asymptote y  53.

Thus, the line y  s23 is also a horizontal asymptote. 
A vertical asymptote is likely to occur when the denominator, 3x  5, is 0, that is, 
when x  5. If x is close to 5 and x  5 , then the denominator is close to 0 and 3x  5

The vertical asymptote is x  35 . All three asymptotes are shown in Figure 8. 


EXAMPLE 5 Compute lim (sx2  1  x). 

x l  

SOLUTION Because both sx2  1 and x are large when x is large, it’s difficult to see what 
happens to their difference, so we use algebra to rewrite the function. We first multiply 
numerator and denominator by the conjugate radical: 

(sx2  1  x) sx2  1  x 

lim (sx2  1  x)  lim

The Squeeze Theorem could be used to show that this limit is 0. But an easier method is 
to divide numerator and denominator by x. Doing this and using the Limit Laws, we obtain

Infinite Limits at Infinity 

The notation

is used to indicate that the values of f x become large as x becomes large. Similar meanings

In fact, we can make x3 as big as we like by taking x large enough. Therefore, we can

The next example shows that by using infinite limits at infinity, together with intercepts, 
we can get a rough idea of the graph of a polynomial without having to plot a large number 
of points. 

EXAMPLE 11 Sketch the graph of y  x  24x  13x  1 by finding its intercepts 
and its limits as x l  and as x l . 

SOLUTION The y-intercept is f 0  24131  16 and the x-intercepts are 
found by setting y  0: x  2, 1, 1. Notice that since x  24 is positive, the function 
doesn’t change sign at 2; thus, the graph doesn’t cross the x-axis at 2. The graph crosses 
the axis at 1 and 1. 

When x is large positive, all three factors are large, so 

lim x  24x  13x  1  

When x is large negative, the first factor is large positive and the second and third factors

Precise Definitions 

Definition 1 can be stated precisely as follows. 

7 
Definition Let f be a function defined on some interval a, . Then 
lim f x  L 
x l  

means that for every  0 there is a corresponding number N such that 
 f x  L   whenever x  N 

In words, this says that the values of f x can be made arbitrarily close to L (within a 
distance , where  is any positive number) by taking x sufficiently large (larger than N, 
where N depends on ). Graphically it says that by choosing x large enough (larger than 


144 .... CHAPTER 2 LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES 

some number N ) we can make the graph of f lie between the given horizontal lines 
y  L and y  L as in Figure 14. This must be true no matter how small we 
choose . Figure 15 shows that if a smaller value of is chosen, then a larger value of N 
may be required.

SOLUTION We rewrite the given inequality as 

3x2 x 2

5x2 4x 1 

We need to determine the values of x for which the given curve lies between the horizontal 
lines y  0.5 and y  0.7. So we graph the curve and these lines in Figure 17. Then 
we use the cursor to estimate that the curve crosses the line y  0.5 when x  6.7. To 
the right of this number the curve stays between the lines y  0.5 and y  0.7. Rounding

|||| 2.7 Tangents, Velocities, and Other Rates of Change 

In Section 2.1 we guessed the values of slopes of tangent lines and velocities on the basis 
of numerical evidence. Now that we have defined limits and have learned techniques for 
computing them, we return to the tangent and velocity problems with the ability to calculate 
slopes of tangents, velocities, and other rates of change. 

Tangents 

If a curve C has equation y  f x and we want to find the tangent line to C at the point 
Pa, f a, then we consider a nearby point Qx, f x, where x  a, and compute the slope 
of the secant line PQ: 

f x  f a 

mPQ  

x  a 

Then we let Q approach P along the curve C by letting x approach a. If mPQ approaches a 
number m, then we define the tangent t to be the line through P with slope m. (This 
amounts to saying that the tangent line is the limiting position of the secant line PQ as Q 
approaches P. See Figure 1.)

We sometimes refer to the slope of the tangent line to a curve at a point as the slope of 
the curve at the point. The idea is that if we zoom in far enough toward the point, the curve 
looks almost like a straight line. Figure 2 illustrates this procedure for the curve y  x2 in 
Example 1. The more we zoom in, the more the parabola looks like a line. In other words, 
the curve becomes almost indistinguishable from its tangent line.

At the point (1, 1), we have a  1, so the slope of the tangent is m  1(2s1)  12. 
At (4, 2), we have m  1(2s4)  14; at (9, 3), m  1(2s9)  16. 

Velocities 

In Section 2.1 we investigated the motion of a ball dropped from the CN Tower and defined 
its velocity to be the limiting value of average velocities over shorter and shorter time 
periods. 

In general, suppose an object moves along a straight line according to an equation of 
motion s  f t, where s is the displacement (directed distance) of the object from the origin 
at time t. The function f that describes the motion is called the position function 
of the object. In the time interval from t  a to t  a  h the change in position is 
f a  h  f a. (See Figure 5.) The average velocity over this time interval is 

displacement f a  h  f a

SECTION 2.7 TANGENTS, VELOCITIES, AND OTHER RATES OF CHANGE .... 153 

Now suppose we compute the average velocities over shorter and shorter time intervals 
a, a  h. In other words, we let h approach 0. As in the example of the falling ball, we 
define the velocity (or instantaneous velocity) va at time t  a to be the limit of these 
average velocities:

This means that the velocity at time t  a is equal to the slope of the tangent line at P 

(compare Equations 2 and 3). 

Now that we know how to compute limits, let’s reconsider the problem of the fall


ing ball. 

EXAMPLE 4 Suppose that a ball is dropped from the upper observation deck of the 
CN Tower, 450 m above the ground. 

(a) What is the velocity of the ball after 5 seconds? 
(b) How fast is the ball traveling when it hits the ground? 
|||| Recall from Section 2.1: The distance SOLUTION We first use the equation of motion s  f t  4.9t2 to find the velocity va

Other Rates of Change 

Suppose y is a quantity that depends on another quantity x. Thus, y is a function of x and 
we write y  f x. If x changes from x1 to x2, then the change in x (also called the increment 
of ) is

By analogy with velocity, we consider the average rate of change over smaller and

|||| A NOTE ON UNITS 

The units for the average rate of change 

T
x are the units for 
T divided by the 
units for 
x, namely, degrees Celsius per hour. 
The instantaneous rate of change is the limit of 
the average rates of change, so it is measured 
in the same units: degrees Celsius per hour. 

EXAMPLE 5 Temperature readings T (in degrees Celsius) were recorded every hour starting 
at midnight on a day in April in Whitefish, Montana. The time x is measured in hours 
from midnight. The data are given in the table at the left. 

(a) Find the average rate of change of temperature with respect to time 
(i) from noon to 3 P.M. (ii) from noon to 2 P.M. 
(iii) from noon to 1 P.M. 
(b) Estimate the instantaneous rate of change at noon. 
SOLUTION 

(a) (i) From noon to 3 P.M. the temperature changes from 14.3°C to 18.2°C, so 

T  T15  T12  18.2  14.3  3.9C 

while the change in time is

(b) We plot the given data in Figure 8 and use them to sketch a smooth curve that

point P where x  12 and, after measuring the sides of triangle ABC, we estimate that

The velocity of a particle is the rate of change of displacement with respect to time. 
Physicists are interested in other rates of change as well—for instance, the rate of change 
of work with respect to time (which is called power). Chemists who study a chemical reaction 
are interested in the rate of change in the concentration of a reactant with respect to 
time (called the rate of reaction). A steel manufacturer is interested in the rate of change 
of the cost of producing x tons of steel per day with respect to x (called the marginal cost). 
A biologist is interested in the rate of change of the population of a colony of bacteria with 
respect to time. In fact, the computation of rates of change is important in all of the natural 
sciences, in engineering, and even in the social sciences. Further examples will be 
given in Section 3.3. 

All these rates of change can be interpreted as slopes of tangents. This gives added significance 
to the solution of the tangent problem. Whenever we solve a problem involving 
tangent lines, we are not just solving a problem in geometry. We are also implicitly solving 
a great variety of problems involving rates of change in science and engineering.

Interpretation of the Derivative as the Slope of a Tangent 

In Section 2.7 we defined the tangent line to the curve y  f x at the point Pa, f a to 
be the line that passes through P and has slope m given by Equation 1. Since, by Definition 
2, this is the same as the derivative f a, we can now say the following. 

The tangent line to y  f x at a, f a is the line through a, f a whose slope is 
equal to f a, the derivative of f at a. 

Thus, the geometric interpretation of a derivative [as defined by either (2) or (3)] is as 
shown in Figure 1.

If we use the point-slope form of the equation of a line, we can write an equation of the

Interpretation of the Derivative as a Rate of Change 

In Section 2.7 we defined the instantaneous rate of change of y  f xwith respect to x at 
x  x1 as the limit of the average rates of change over smaller and smaller intervals. If the 
interval is x1, x2, then the change in x is x  x2  x1, the corresponding change in y is 

y  f x2 f x1 

and 

4 
yf x2 f x1 

instantaneous rate of change  lim  lim 

x l0 xx2 lx1 x2  x1 

From Equation 3 we recognize this limit as being the derivative of f at x1, that is, f x1. 
This gives a second interpretation of the derivative: 

The derivative f ais the instantaneous rate of change of y  f xwith respect to 
x when x  a. 

The connection with the first interpretation is that if we sketch the curve y  f x, then 
the instantaneous rate of change is the slope of the tangent to this curve at the point where

The y-values are changing rapidly 
at P and slowly at Q.

and order the slopes of tangent and 
secant lines at several points on a curve.

x  a. This means that when the derivative is large (and therefore the curve is steep, as at 
the point P in Figure 4), the y-values change rapidly. When the derivative is small, the 
curve is relatively flat and the y-values change slowly. 

In particular, if s  f t is the position function of a particle that moves along a straight 
line, then f a is the rate of change of the displacement s with respect to the time t. In 
other words, f a is the velocity of the particle at time t  a. (See Section 2.7.) The speed 
of the particle is the absolute value of the velocity, that is, 
 f a
. 

EXAMPLE 4 The position of a particle is given by the equation of motion 
s  f t  11  t, where t is measured in seconds and s in meters. Find the velocity 
and the speed after 2 seconds.

EXAMPLE 5 A manufacturer produces bolts of a fabric with a fixed width. The cost of 
producing x yards of this fabric is C  f x dollars. 

(a) What is the meaning of the derivative f x? What are its units? 
(b) In practical terms, what does it mean to say that f 1000  9? 
(c) Which do you think is greater, f 50 or f 500? What about f 5000? 
SOLUTION 

(a) The derivative f x is the instantaneous rate of change of C with respect to x; that 
is, f x means the rate of change of the production cost with respect to the number of 
yards produced. (Economists call this rate of change the marginal cost. This idea is discussed 
in more detail in Sections 3.3 and 4.8.) 
Because 

C 

f x  lim 

x l 0 x 

the units for f x are the same as the units for the difference quotient Cx. Since 
C is measured in dollars and x in yards, it follows that the units for f x are dollars 
per yard. 

(b) The statement that f 1000  9 means that, after 1000 yards of fabric have been 
manufactured, the rate at which the production cost is increasing is $9yard. (When 
x  1000, C is increasing 9 times as fast as x.) 

162 .... CHAPTER 2 LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES 

Since x  1 is small compared with x  1000, we could use the approximation 

|||| Here we are assuming that the cost function 

C C

is well behaved; in other words, Cxdoesn’t f 1000	  C 
oscillate rapidly near x  1000. x 1 

and say that the cost of manufacturing the 1000th yard (or the 1001st) is about $9. 

(c) The rate at which the production cost is increasing (per yard) is probably lower 
when x  500 than when x  50 (the cost of making the 500th yard is less than the cost 
of the 50th yard) because of economies of scale. (The manufacturer makes more efficient 
use of the fixed costs of production.) So 
f 50 f 500 

But, as production expands, the resulting large-scale operation might become inefficient 
and there might be overtime costs. Thus, it is possible that the rate of increase of costs 
will eventually start to rise. So it may happen that 

f 5000 f 500 


The following example shows how to estimate the derivative of a tabular function, that 
is, a function defined not by a formula but by a table of values.

930.2 dollars, from 1980 to 2000. Interpret and estimate the value of D1990. 
1985 

1945.9 

SOLUTION The derivative D1990means the rate of change of D with respect to t when

1990 

3233.3 

t  1990, that is, the rate of increase of the national debt in 1990.

1995

According to Equation 3,

5674.2 

Dt D1990 

D1990 lim

So we compute and tabulate values of the difference quotient (the average rates of 
change) as follows.

Early Methods for Finding Tangents 

The first person to formulate explicitly the ideas of limits and derivatives was Sir Isaac Newton in 
the 1660s. But Newton acknowledged that “If I have seen further than other men, it is because I 
have stood on the shoulders of giants.” Two of those giants were Pierre Fermat (1601–1665) and 
Newton’s teacher at Cambridge, Isaac Barrow (1630–1677). Newton was familiar with the methods 
that these men used to find tangent lines, and their methods played a role in Newton’s eventual 
formulation of calculus. 


SECTION 2.9 THE DERIVATIVE AS A FUNCTION .... 165 

The following references contain explanations of these methods. Read one or more of the 
references and write a report comparing the methods of either Fermat or Barrow to modern methods. 
In particular, use the method of Section 2.8 to find an equation of the tangent line to the 
curve y  x3  2x at the point (1, 3) and show how either Fermat or Barrow would have solved 
the same problem. Although you used derivatives and they did not, point out similarities between 
the methods.

|||| 2.9 The Derivative as a Function 


In the preceding section we considered the derivative of a function f at a fixed number a: 
f a  h  f a 

1
f a  lim 

h l 0 h 

Here we change our point of view and let the number a vary. If we replace a in Equation 1 
by a variable x, we obtain 

2 
f x  h  f x 

f x  lim 

h l 0 h 

Given any number x for which this limit exists, we assign to x the number f x. So we can 
regard f  as a new function, called the derivative of f and defined by Equation 2. We 
know that the value of f  at x, f x, can be interpreted geometrically as the slope of the 
tangent line to the graph of f at the point x, f x. 

The function f  is called the derivative of f because it has been “derived” from f by 
the limiting operation in Equation 2. The domain of f  is the set x 
 f x

exists and may 
be smaller than the domain of f .

the derivative f .

|||| Notice that where the derivative is positive 
(to the right of C and between A and B), the 
function f is increasing. Where f x is negative 
(to the left of A and between B and C), f is 
decreasing. In Section 4.3 we will prove that this 
is true for all functions. 


SOLUTION We can estimate the value of the derivative at any value of by drawing the 
tangent at the point and estimating its slope. For instance, for x  5 we draw the 
tangent at in Figure 2(a) and estimate its slope to be about , so . This 
allows us to plot the point on the graph of directly beneath P. Repeating 
this procedure at several points, we get the graph shown in Figure 2(b). Notice that the 
tangents at , , and are horizontal, so the derivative is 0 there and the graph of 
crosses the -axis at the points , , and , directly beneath A, B, and C. Between 
and the tangents have positive slope, so is positive there. But between and 
the tangents have negative slope, so is negative there.

EXAMPLE 2 Let Btbe the population of Belgium at time t. The table at the left gives 
midyear values of Bt, in thousands, from 1980 to 2000. Construct a table of values for 
the derivative of this function. 

SOLUTION We assume that there were no wild fluctuations in the population between the 
stated values. Let’s start by approximating B1988, the rate of increase of the population 
of Belgium in mid-1988. Since 

B1988  h B1988 

B1988 lim

we have 
B1988  h B1988

h 
for small values of h. 
For h  2, we get 
B1990 B1988 9962  9884 

B1988	  39 

22 

(This is the average rate of increase between 1988 and 1990.) For h  2, we have 

B1986 B1988 9862  9884 

B1988	  11 

2 2 

which is the average rate of increase between 1986 and 1988. We get a more accurate 
approximation if we take the average of these rates of change: 

B1988	1239  11 25 

This means that in 1988 the population was increasing at a rate of about 25,000 people 
per year. 

Making similar calculations for the other values (except at the endpoints), we get the 
table at the left, which shows the approximate values for the derivative.

(b) Illustrate by comparing the graphs of f and f. 
SOLUTION 

(a) When using Equation 2 to compute a derivative, we must remember that the variable 
is h and that x is temporarily regarded as a constant during the calculation of the limit.

(b) We use a graphing device to graph f and f in Figure 4. Notice that fx  0 when 
f has horizontal tangents and fx is positive when the tangents have positive slope. So 
these graphs serve as a check on our work in part (a).

We see that fx exists if x  1, so the domain of f is 1, . This is smaller than 
the domain of f, which is 1, . 


Let’s check to see that the result of Example 4 is reasonable by looking at the graphs of 
f and f in Figure 5. When x is close to 1, sx  1 is close to 0, so fx  1(2sx  1) 
is very large; this corresponds to the steep tangent lines near 1, 0 in Figure 5(a) and the 
large values of fx just to the right of 1 in Figure 5(b). When x is large, fx is very 
small; this corresponds to the flatter tangent lines at the far right of the graph of f and the 
horizontal asymptote of the graph of f.

If we use the traditional notation y  f x to indicate that the independent variable is x and 
the dependent variable is y, then some common alternative notations for the derivative are 
as follows: 

dydf d 

f x  y  f x  Df x  Dx f x 

dx dx dx 

The symbols D and ddx are called differentiation operators because they indicate the 
operation of differentiation, which is the process of calculating a derivative. 

The symbol dydx, which was introduced by Leibniz, should not be regarded as a ratio 
(for the time being); it is simply a synonym for f x. Nonetheless, it is a very useful and 
suggestive notation, especially when used in conjunction with increment notation. 
Referring to Equation 2.8.4, we can rewrite the definition of derivative in Leibniz notation 
in the form 

dy y

 lim 

dx x l 0 x 


170 .... CHAPTER 2 LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES 

|||| Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was born in 
Leipzig in 1646 and studied law, theology, 
philosophy, and mathematics at the university 
there, graduating with a bachelor’s degree at age 

17. After earning his doctorate in law at age 20, 
Leibniz entered the diplomatic service and spent 
most of his life traveling to the capitals of Europe 
on political missions. In particular, he worked to 
avert a French military threat against Germany 
and attempted to reconcile the Catholic and 
Protestant churches. 
His serious study of mathematics did not 
begin until 1672 while he was on a diplomatic 
mission in Paris. There he built a calculating 
machine and met scientists, like Huygens, who 
directed his attention to the latest developments 
in mathematics and science. Leibniz sought to 
develop a symbolic logic and system of notation 
that would simplify logical reasoning. In particular, 
the version of calculus that he published in 
1684 established the notation and the rules for 
finding derivatives that we use today. 

Unfortunately, a dreadful priority dispute arose 
in the 1690s between the followers of Newton 
and those of Leibniz as to who had invented 
calculus first. Leibniz was even accused of 
plagiarism by members of the Royal Society in 
England. The truth is that each man invented 
calculus independently. Newton arrived at his 
version of calculus first but, because of his fear 
of controversy, did not publish it immediately. So 
Leibniz’s 1684 account of calculus was the first 
to be published. 

If we want to indicate the value of a derivative dydx in Leibniz notation at a specific number 
a, we use the notation 

dy dy 

or 

dx xa dxxa 

which is a synonym for f a. 

3 
Definition A function f is differentiable at a if f a exists. It is differentiable 
on an open interval a, b [or a,  or , a or , ] if it is differentiable 
at every number in the interval. 
EXAMPLE 6 Where is the function f x   x  differentiable? 

SOLUTION If x  0, then  x   x and we can choose h small enough that x  h  0 and 
hence  x  h   x  h. Therefore, for x  0 we have 

 x  h    x 

f x  lim 

h l 0 h 

x  h  xh 

 lim  lim  lim 1  1 

h l 0 hh l 0 hh l 0

and so f is differentiable for any x  0. 

Similarly, for x  0 we have  x   x and h can be chosen small enough that 
x  h  0 and so  x  h   x  h. Therefore, for x  0, 

 x  h    x 

f x  lim 

h l 0 h 

x  h  x h 

 lim  lim  lim 1  1 

h l 0 hh l 0 hh l 0 

and so f is differentiable for any x  0. 
For x  0 we have to investigate 

f 0  h  f 0 

f 0  lim 

h l 0 h 

 0  h    0 

 lim if it exists 

h l 0 h 

Let’s compute the left and right limits separately: 

 0  h    0  h  h 

lim  lim  lim  lim 1  1 

h l 0 hh l 0 hh l 0 hh l 0

 0  h    0  h  h 

and lim  lim  lim  lim 1  1

h l 0 hh l 0 hh l 0 hh l 0 

Since these limits are different, f 0does not exist. Thus, f is differentiable at all x 
except 0.

SECTION 2.9 THE DERIVATIVE AS A FUNCTION .... 171 

A formula for f  is given by 

if x  0 

f x  
1 

1 if x  0 

and its graph is shown in Figure 6(b). The fact that f 0 does not exist is reflected geometrically 
in the fact that the curve y   x  does not have a tangent line at 0, 0. 
[See Figure 6(a).] 

Both continuity and differentiability are desirable properties for a function to have. The 
following theorem shows how these properties are related. 

4 
Theorem If f is differentiable at a, then f is continuous at a. 

(b) y=fª(x) 
FIGURE 6 

Proof To prove that f is continuous at a, we have to show that limx l af x  f a. We 
do this by showing that the difference f x  f a approaches 0. 
The given information is that f is differentiable at a, that is, 

f x  f a 

f a  lim 

x l ax  a 

exists (see Equation 2.8.3). To connect the given and the unknown, we divide and multiply 
f x  f a by x  a (which we can do when x  a): 

f x  f a 

f x  f a  x  a 

x  a 

Thus, using the Product Law and (2.8.3), we can write 

f x  f a 

lim  f x  f a  lim x  a 

x l ax l ax  a 
f x  f a 

 lim lim x  a

x l ax  ax l a 

 f a  0  0 
To use what we have just proved, we start with f x and add and subtract f a: 
lim f x  lim  f a   f x  f a. 


x l ax l a 

 lim f a  lim  f x  f a

x l ax l a 

 f a  0  f a. 
Therefore, f is continuous at a. 





| NOTE The converse of Theorem 4 is false; that is, there are functions that are continuous 
but not differentiable. For instance, the function f x   x  is continuous at 0 because 

lim f x  lim  x   0  f 0 

x l 0 x l 0 

(See Example 7 in Section 2.3.) But in Example 6 we showed that f is not differentiable 
at 0. 


172 .... CHAPTER 2 LIMITS AND DERIVATIVES 

How Can a Function Fail to Be Differentiable? 

We saw that the function y   x  in Example 6 is not differentiable at 0 and Figure 6(a) 
shows that its graph changes direction abruptly when x  0. In general, if the graph of a 
function f has a “corner” or “kink” in it, then the graph of f has no tangent at this point 
and f is not differentiable there. [In trying to compute f a, we find that the left and right 
limits are different.]

y

Theorem 4 gives another way for a function not to have a derivative. It says that if f is 

not continuous at a, then f is not differentiable at a. So at any discontinuity (for instance, 

a jump discontinuity) f fails to be differentiable. 

A third possibility is that the curve has a vertical tangent line when x  a; that is, f 
is continuous at a and 

lim  f x   

x l a 

This means that the tangent lines become steeper and steeper as x l a. Figure 7 shows 

FIGURE 7 

one way that this can happen; Figure 8(c) shows another. Figure 8 illustrates the three possibilities 
that we have discussed.

A graphing calculator or computer provides another way of looking at differentiability. 
If f is differentiable at a, then when we zoom in toward the point a, f a the graph 
straightens out and appears more and more like a line. (See Figure 9. We saw a specific 
example of this in Figure 3 in Section 2.8.) But no matter how much we zoom in toward a 
point like the ones in Figures 7 and 8(a), we can’t eliminate the sharp point or corner (see 
Figure 10).

PROBLEMS 
PLUS 

In our discussion of the principles of problem solving we considered the problem-solving 
strategy of introducing something extra (see page 80). In the following example we show 
how this principle is sometimes useful when we evaluate limits. The idea is to change the 
variable—to introduce a new variable that is related to the original variable—in such a way 
as to make the problem simpler. Later, in Section 5.5, we will make more extensive use of 
this general idea. 

s31  cx  1

EXAMPLE 1 Evaluate lim , where c is a constant. 

x l 0 x 

SOLUTION As it stands, this limit looks challenging. In Section 2.3 we evaluated several limits 
in which both numerator and denominator approached 0. There our strategy was to perform 
some sort of algebraic manipulation that led to a simplifying cancellation, but here 
it’s not clear what kind of algebra is necessary. 

So we introduce a new variable t by the equation 

3

t  s1  cx 

We also need to express x in terms of t, so we solve this equation: 

t3  1  cx 

t3  1 

x  

c 

Notice that x l 0 is equivalent to t l 1. This allows us to convert the given limit into one 
involving the variable t: 

3

s1  cx  1 t  1 

lim  lim 

x l 0 xt l1 t3  1c 

ct  1 

 lim 

t l1 t3  1

The change of variable allowed us to replace a relatively complicated limit by a simpler 
one of a type that we have seen before. Factoring the denominator as a difference of 
cubes, we get 

ct  1 ct  1 

lim  lim 

t l1 t3  1 t l1 t  1t2  t  1 

cc 

 lim  

t l1 t2  t  13

The following problems are meant to test and challenge your problem-solving skills. 
Some of them require a considerable amount of time to think through, so don’t be discouraged 
if you can’t solve them right away. If you get stuck, you might find it helpful to refer 
to the discussion of the principles of problem solving on page 80.

By measuring slopes at points on the sine curve, 
(Chapter) 
we get strong visual evidence that the derivative 
of the sine function is the cosine function. 


Differentiation Rules 



We have seen how to interpret derivatives as slopes and 
rates of change. We have seen how to estimate derivatives 
of functions given by tables of values. We have learned 

how to graph derivatives of functions that are defined 
graphically. We have used the definition of a derivative to 
calculate the derivatives of functions defined by formulas. But it would be tedious 
if we always had to use the definition, so in this chapter we develop rules for finding 
derivatives without having to use the definition directly. These differentiation 
rules enable us to calculate with relative ease the derivatives of polynomials, 
rational functions, algebraic functions, exponential and logarithmic functions, and 
trigonometric and inverse trigonometric functions. We then use these rules to solve 
problems involving rates of change and the approximation of functions.

Let’s start with the simplest of all functions, the constant function f x  c. The graph 

of this function is the horizontal line y  c, which has slope 0, so we must have f x  0. 

(See Figure 1.) A formal proof, from the definition of a derivative, is also easy:

New Derivatives from Old 

When new functions are formed from old functions by addition, subtraction, or multiplication 
by a constant, their derivatives can be calculated in terms of derivatives of the old 
functions. In particular, the following formula says that the derivative of a constant times 
a function is the constant times the derivative of the function.

The factor ax doesn’t depend on h, so we can take it in front of the limit: 
ah  1 

f x ax lim

Notice that the limit is the value of the derivative of f at 0, that is, 
ah  1 

lim  f 0 

h l 0 h 

Therefore, we have shown that if the exponential function f x ax is differentiable at 0, 
then it is differentiable everywhere and 

4 f x f 0ax 

This equation says that the rate of change of any exponential function is proportional to 
the function itself. (The slope is proportional to the height.) 

Numerical evidence for the existence of f 0is given in the table at the left for the 
cases a  2 and a  3. (Values are stated correct to four decimal places. For the case 
a  2, see also Example 3 in Section 2.8.) It appears that the limits exist and

Of all possible choices for the base a in Equation 4, the simplest differentiation formula

that there is a number a between 2 and 3 for which f 0 1. It is traditional to 
denote this value by the letter . (In fact, that is how we introduced e in Section 1.5.) Thus,

Thus, the exponential function f x  ehas the property that it is its own derivative.

The function f and its derivative f  are graphed in Figure 8. Notice that f has a horizontal 
tangent when x  0; this corresponds to the fact that f 0  0. Notice also that, 
for x  0, f x is positive and f is increasing. When x  0, f x is negative and f is 
decreasing. 


EXAMPLE 8 At what point on the curve y  ex is the tangent line parallel to the 
line y  2x? 

SOLUTION Since y  ex, we have y  ex. Let the x-coordinate of the point in question be 

a. Then the slope of the tangent line at that point is ea. This tangent line will be parallel 
to the line y  2x if it has the same slope, that is, 2. Equating slopes, we get 
ea  2 a  ln 2 

Therefore, the required point is a, ea   ln 2, 2. (See Figure 9.)

Velocity, density, and current are not the only rates of change that are important in 

physics. Others include power (the rate at which work is done), the rate of heat flow, tem


perature gradient (the rate of change of temperature with respect to position), and the rate 

of decay of a radioactive substance in nuclear physics. 


Chemistry 
EXAMPLE 4 A chemical reaction results in the formation of one or more substances 
(called products) from one or more starting materials (called reactants). For instance, the 
“equation” 

2H2  O2 l 2H2O 

indicates that two molecules of hydrogen and one molecule of oxygen form two molecules 
of water. Let’s consider the reaction 

A  B l C 

where A and B are the reactants and C is the product. The concentration of a reactant 
A is the number of moles (1 mole  6.022  1023 molecules) per liter and is denoted by 
A. The concentration varies during a reaction, so A, B, and C are all functions of 
time t. The average rate of reaction of the product C over a time interval t1  t  t2 is 

CCt2   Ct1 

tt2  t1 

But chemists are more interested in the instantaneous rate of reaction, which is 
obtained by taking the limit of the average rate of reaction as the time interval t 
approaches 0: 

C dC 

rate of reaction  lim  

t l 0 t dt 

Since the concentration of the product increases as the reaction proceeds, the derivative 
dCdt will be positive. (You can see intuitively that the slope of the tangent to the 
graph of an increasing function is positive.) Thus, the rate of reaction of C is positive. 
The concentrations of the reactants, however, decrease during the reaction, so, to make 
the rates of reaction of A and B positive numbers, we put minus signs in front of the 
derivatives dAdt and dBdt  B each decrease at the same rate that 

. Since A and  
C increases, we have 

dC dA dB 

rate of reaction     

dt dt dt 

More generally, it turns out that for a reaction of the form 

aA  bB l cC  dD 

we have 

1 dA 1 dB 1 dC 1 dD 

adt bdt cdt ddt 


SECTION 3.3 RATES OF CHANGE IN THE NATURAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCES .... 203 

The rate of reaction can be determined by graphical methods (see Exercise 22). In some 
cases we can use the rate of reaction to find explicit formulas for the concentrations as 
functions of time (see Exercises 9.3). 

EXAMPLE 5 One of the quantities of interest in thermodynamics is compressibility. If a 
given substance is kept at a constant temperature, then its volume V depends on its pressure 
P. We can consider the rate of change of volume with respect to pressure— namely, 
the derivative dVdP. As P increases, V decreases, so dVdP 	 0. The compressibility 
is defined by introducing a minus sign and dividing this derivative by the volume V: 

1 dV 

isothermal compressibility  

V dP 

Thus, 

measures how fast, per unit volume, the volume of a substance decreases as the 

pressure on it increases at constant temperature. 

For instance, the volume V (in cubic meters) of a sample of air at 25C was found to 
be related to the pressure P (in kilopascals) by the equation

Biology 

EXAMPLE 6 Let n  f t be the number of individuals in an animal or plant population 
at time t. The change in the population size between the times t  t1 and t  t2 is 
n  f t2   f t1, and so the average rate of growth during the time period t1  t  t2 
is 

nf t2   f t1 

average rate of growth  

tt2  t1 

The instantaneous rate of growth is obtained from this average rate of growth by letting 
the time period t approach 0: 

n dn 

growth rate  lim  

t l 0 t dt 


204 .... CHAPTER 3 DIFFERENTIATION RULES 

Strictly speaking, this is not quite accurate because the actual graph of a population 
function n  f twould be a step function that is discontinuous whenever a birth or 
death occurs and, therefore, not differentiable. However, for a large animal or plant 
population, we can replace the graph by a smooth approximating curve as in Figure 5.

To be more specific, consider a population of bacteria in a homogeneous nutrient 
medium. Suppose that by sampling the population at certain intervals it is determined 
that the population doubles every hour. If the initial population is n0 and the time t is 
measured in hours, then 

f 1 2f 0 2n0 

f 2 2f 1 22n0 

f 3 2f 2 23n0 

and, in general, 
f t 2tn0 

The population function is n  n02t . 
In Section 3.1 we discussed derivatives of exponential functions and found that 

d 

2x 0.692x

So the rate of growth of the bacteria population at time t is 
dn d 

 n02t n00.692t 

dt dt 

For example, suppose that we start with an initial population of n0  100 bacteria. Then 
the rate of growth after 4 hours is 

dn 

1000.6924  1104 

dt t4 

This means that, after 4 hours, the bacteria population is growing at a rate of about 
1100 bacteria per hour.

EXAMPLE 7 When we consider the flow of blood through a blood vessel, such as a vein or 
artery, we can take the shape of the blood vessel to be a cylindrical tube with radius R 
and length l as illustrated in Figure 6. 

R r 
l 
FIGURE 6 

Blood flow in an artery 

Because of friction at the walls of the tube, the velocity v of the blood is greatest 
along the central axis of the tube and decreases as the distance r from the axis increases 
until v becomes 0 at the wall. The relationship between v and r is given by the law of 
laminar flow discovered by the French physician Jean-Louis-Marie Poiseuille in 1840. 
This states that 

P

R2  r2 

where 

is the viscosity of the blood and P is the pressure difference between the ends 

of the tube. If P and l are constant, then v is a function of r with domain 0, R. [For 
more detailed information, see W. Nichols and M. O’Rourke (eds.), McDonald’s Blood 
Flow in Arteries: Theoretic, Experimental, and Clinical Principles, 4th ed. (New York: 
Oxford University Press, 1998).] 

The average rate of change of the velocity as we move from r  r1 outward to r  r2 
is given by 

vvr2  vr1 

rr2  r1 

and if we let r l 0, we obtain the velocity gradient, that is, the instantaneous rate of 
change of velocity with respect to r:

To get a feeling for what this statement means, let’s change our units from centimeters 
to micrometers (1 cm  10,000 m). Then the radius of the artery is 80 m. The 
velocity at the central axis is 11,850 ms, which decreases to 11,110 ms at a distance 
of r  20 m. The fact that dvdr  74 (ms)m means that, when r  20 m, the 
velocity is decreasing at a rate of about 74 ms for each micrometer that we proceed 
away from the center. 

Economics 

EXAMPLE 8 Suppose Cx is the total cost that a company incurs in producing x units of 
a certain commodity. The function C is called a cost function. If the number of items 
produced is increased from x1 to x2, the additional cost is C  Cx2  Cx1, and the 
average rate of change of the cost is 

CC x2  C x1 C x1 x Cx1 

xx2 x1 x 

The limit of this quantity as x l 0, that is, the instantaneous rate of change of cost 
with respect to the number of items produced, is called the marginal cost by economists: 

C dC 

marginal cost  lim  

x l 0 x dx 

[Since x often takes on only integer values, it may not make literal sense to let x 
approach 0, but we can always replace C x by a smooth approximating function as in 
Example 6.] 

Taking x  1 and n large (so that x is small compared to n), we have 

Cn Cn 1 Cn 

Thus, the marginal cost of producing n units is approximately equal to the cost of producing 
one more unit [the n 1st unit]. 

It is often appropriate to represent a total cost function by a polynomial 

C x  a bx cx2 dx3 

where a represents the overhead cost (rent, heat, maintenance) and the other terms 
represent the cost of raw materials, labor, and so on. (The cost of raw materials may be 
proportional to x, but labor costs might depend partly on higher powers of x because of 
overtime costs and inefficiencies involved in large-scale operations.) 

For instance, suppose a company has estimated that the cost (in dollars) of producing 
x items is 

Cx  10,000 5x 0.01x2 

Then the marginal cost function is 

Cx  5 0.02x 


SECTION 3.3 RATES OF CHANGE IN THE NATURAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCES .... 207 

The marginal cost at the production level of 500 items is 

C500 5  0.02500 $15item 

This gives the rate at which costs are increasing with respect to the production level 
when x  500 and predicts the cost of the 501st item. 

The actual cost of producing the 501st item is 

C501 C500 10,000  5501 0.015012  
 10,000  5500 0.015002  

 $15.01 
Notice that C500C501 C500. 

Economists also study marginal demand, marginal revenue, and marginal profit, which 
are the derivatives of the demand, revenue, and profit functions. These will be considered 
in Chapter 4 after we have developed techniques for finding the maximum and minimum 
values of functions. 

Other Sciences 

Rates of change occur in all the sciences. A geologist is interested in knowing the rate at 
which an intruded body of molten rock cools by conduction of heat into surrounding rocks. 
An engineer wants to know the rate at which water flows into or out of a reservoir. An 
urban geographer is interested in the rate of change of the population density in a city as 
the distance from the city center increases. A meteorologist is concerned with the rate of 
change of atmospheric pressure with respect to height (see Exercise 17 in Section 9.4). 

In psychology, those interested in learning theory study the so-called learning curve, 
which graphs the performance Ptof someone learning a skill as a function of the training 
time . Of particular interest is the rate at which performance improves as time passes, 

t 
that is, dPdt. 

In sociology, differential calculus is used in analyzing the spread of rumors (or innovations 
or fads or fashions). If ptdenotes the proportion of a population that knows a rumor 
by time , then the derivative dpdt represents the rate of spread of the rumor (see Exer


t 

cise 70 in Section 3.5). 

Summary 

Velocity, density, current, power, and temperature gradient in physics, rate of reaction and 
compressibility in chemistry, rate of growth and blood velocity gradient in biology, marginal 
cost and marginal profit in economics, rate of heat flow in geology, rate of improvement 
of performance in psychology, rate of spread of a rumor in sociology—these are all 
special cases of a single mathematical concept, the derivative. 

This is an illustration of the fact that part of the power of mathematics lies in its 
abstractness. A single abstract mathematical concept (such as the derivative) can have different 
interpretations in each of the sciences. When we develop the properties of the mathematical 
concept once and for all, we can then turn around and apply these results to all of 
the sciences. This is much more efficient than developing properties of special concepts in 
each separate science. The French mathematician Joseph Fourier (1768–1830) put it succinctly: 
“Mathematics compares the most diverse phenomena and discovers the secret 
analogies that unite them.”

SECTION 3.4 DERIVATIVES OF TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS .... 211

|||| We have used the addition formula for sine. 
See Appendix D. 

Before starting this section, you might need to review the trigonometric functions. In particular, 
it is important to remember that when we talk about the function f defined for all 
real numbers x by 

f x  sin x 

it is understood that sin x means the sine of the angle whose radian measure is x. A similar 
convention holds for the other trigonometric functions cos, tan, csc, sec, and cot. Recall 
from Section 2.5 that all of the trigonometric functions are continuous at every number in 
their domains. 

If we sketch the graph of the function f x  sin x and use the interpretation of f x 
as the slope of the tangent to the sine curve in order to sketch the graph of f  (see Exercise 
16 in Section 2.9), then it looks as if the graph of f  may be the same as the cosine 
curve (see Figure 1 and also page 182).

Velocity, density, and current are not the only rates of change that are important in 

physics. Others include power (the rate at which work is done), the rate of heat flow, tem


perature gradient (the rate of change of temperature with respect to position), and the rate 

of decay of a radioactive substance in nuclear physics. 


Chemistry 
EXAMPLE 4 A chemical reaction results in the formation of one or more substances 
(called products) from one or more starting materials (called reactants). For instance, the 
“equation” 

2H2  O2 l 2H2O 

indicates that two molecules of hydrogen and one molecule of oxygen form two molecules 
of water. Let’s consider the reaction 

A  B l C 

where A and B are the reactants and C is the product. The concentration of a reactant 
A is the number of moles (1 mole  6.022  1023 molecules) per liter and is denoted by 
A. The concentration varies during a reaction, so A, B, and C are all functions of 
time t. The average rate of reaction of the product C over a time interval t1  t  t2 is 

CCt2   Ct1 

tt2  t1 

But chemists are more interested in the instantaneous rate of reaction, which is 
obtained by taking the limit of the average rate of reaction as the time interval t 
approaches 0: 

C dC 

rate of reaction  lim  

t l 0 t dt 

Since the concentration of the product increases as the reaction proceeds, the derivative 
dCdt will be positive. (You can see intuitively that the slope of the tangent to the 
graph of an increasing function is positive.) Thus, the rate of reaction of C is positive. 
The concentrations of the reactants, however, decrease during the reaction, so, to make 
the rates of reaction of A and B positive numbers, we put minus signs in front of the 
derivatives dAdt and dBdt  B each decrease at the same rate that 

. Since A and  
C increases, we have 

dC dA dB 

rate of reaction    

More generally, it turns out that for a reaction of the form

we have

adt bdt cdt ddt 


SECTION 3.3 RATES OF CHANGE IN THE NATURAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCES .... 203 

The rate of reaction can be determined by graphical methods (see Exercise 22). In some 
cases we can use the rate of reaction to find explicit formulas for the concentrations as 
functions of time (see Exercises 9.3). 

EXAMPLE 5 One of the quantities of interest in thermodynamics is compressibility. If a 
given substance is kept at a constant temperature, then its volume V depends on its pressure 
P. We can consider the rate of change of volume with respect to pressure— namely, 
the derivative dVdP. As P increases, V decreases, so dVdP 	 0. The compressibility 
is defined by introducing a minus sign and dividing this derivative by the volume V: 

1 dV 

isothermal compressibility  

V dP 

Thus, 

measures how fast, per unit volume, the volume of a substance decreases as the 

pressure on it increases at constant temperature. 

For instance, the volume V (in cubic meters) of a sample of air at 25C was found to 
be related to the pressure P (in kilopascals) by the equation

EXAMPLE 6 Let n  f t be the number of individuals in an animal or plant population 
at time t. The change in the population size between the times t  t1 and t  t2 is 
n  f t2   f t1, and so the average rate of growth during the time period t1  t  t2

Strictly speaking, this is not quite accurate because the actual graph of a population 
function n  f twould be a step function that is discontinuous whenever a birth or 
death occurs and, therefore, not differentiable. However, for a large animal or plant 
population, we can replace the graph by a smooth approximating curve as in Figure 5.

To be more specific, consider a population of bacteria in a homogeneous nutrient

that the population doubles every hour. If the initial population is n0 and the time t is

This means that, after 4 hours, the bacteria population is growing at a rate of about

EXAMPLE 7 When we consider the flow of blood through a blood vessel, such as a vein or 
artery, we can take the shape of the blood vessel to be a cylindrical tube with radius R 
and length l as illustrated in Figure 6. 

R r 
l 
FIGURE 6 

Blood flow in an artery 

Because of friction at the walls of the tube, the velocity v of the blood is greatest 
along the central axis of the tube and decreases as the distance r from the axis increases 
until v becomes 0 at the wall. The relationship between v and r is given by the law of 
laminar flow discovered by the French physician Jean-Louis-Marie Poiseuille in 1840. 
This states that 

P

where 

is the viscosity of the blood and P is the pressure difference between the ends 

of the tube. If P and l are constant, then v is a function of r with domain 0, R. [For 
more detailed information, see W. Nichols and M. O’Rourke (eds.), McDonald’s Blood 
Flow in Arteries: Theoretic, Experimental, and Clinical Principles, 4th ed. (New York: 
Oxford University Press, 1998).] 

The average rate of change of the velocity as we move from r  r1 outward to r  r2 
is given by 

vvr2  vr1 

rr2  r1

To get a feeling for what this statement means, let’s change our units from centimeters 
to micrometers (1 cm  10,000 m). Then the radius of the artery is 80 m. The 
velocity at the central axis is 11,850 ms, which decreases to 11,110 ms at a distance 
of r  20 m. The fact that dvdr  74 (ms)m means that, when r  20 m, the 
velocity is decreasing at a rate of about 74 ms for each micrometer that we proceed 
away from the center. 

Economics 

EXAMPLE 8 Suppose Cx is the total cost that a company incurs in producing x units of 
a certain commodity. The function C is called a cost function. If the number of items 
produced is increased from x1 to x2, the additional cost is C  Cx2  Cx1, and the 
average rate of change of the cost is 

CC x2  C x1 C x1 x Cx1 

xx2 x1 x 

The limit of this quantity as x l 0, that is, the instantaneous rate of change of cost 
with respect to the number of items produced, is called the marginal cost by economists: 

C dC 

marginal cost  lim  

x l 0 x dx 

[Since x often takes on only integer values, it may not make literal sense to let x 
approach 0, but we can always replace C x by a smooth approximating function as in 
Example 6.] 

Taking x  1 and n large (so that x is small compared to n), we have 

Cn Cn 1 Cn 

Thus, the marginal cost of producing n units is approximately equal to the cost of producing 
one more unit [the n 1st unit]. 

It is often appropriate to represent a total cost function by a polynomial 

C x  a bx cx2 dx3 

where a represents the overhead cost (rent, heat, maintenance) and the other terms 
represent the cost of raw materials, labor, and so on. (The cost of raw materials may be 
proportional to x, but labor costs might depend partly on higher powers of x because of 
overtime costs and inefficiencies involved in large-scale operations.) 

For instance, suppose a company has estimated that the cost (in dollars) of producing 
x items is 

Cx  10,000 5x 0.01x2 

Then the marginal cost function is 

Cx  5 0.02x 


SECTION 3.3 RATES OF CHANGE IN THE NATURAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCES .... 207 

The marginal cost at the production level of 500 items is 

C500 5  0.02500 $15item 

This gives the rate at which costs are increasing with respect to the production level 
when x  500 and predicts the cost of the 501st item. 

The actual cost of producing the 501st item is

Economists also study marginal demand, marginal revenue, and marginal profit, which 
are the derivatives of the demand, revenue, and profit functions. These will be considered 
in Chapter 4 after we have developed techniques for finding the maximum and minimum 
values of functions. 

Other Sciences 

Rates of change occur in all the sciences. A geologist is interested in knowing the rate at 
which an intruded body of molten rock cools by conduction of heat into surrounding rocks. 
An engineer wants to know the rate at which water flows into or out of a reservoir. An 
urban geographer is interested in the rate of change of the population density in a city as 
the distance from the city center increases. A meteorologist is concerned with the rate of 
change of atmospheric pressure with respect to height (see Exercise 17 in Section 9.4). 

In psychology, those interested in learning theory study the so-called learning curve, 
which graphs the performance Ptof someone learning a skill as a function of the training 
time . Of particular interest is the rate at which performance improves as time passes, 

t 
that is, dPdt. 

In sociology, differential calculus is used in analyzing the spread of rumors (or innovations 
or fads or fashions). If ptdenotes the proportion of a population that knows a rumor 
by time , then the derivative dpdt represents the rate of spread of the rumor (see Exer


t 

cise 70 in Section 3.5). 

Summary 

Velocity, density, current, power, and temperature gradient in physics, rate of reaction and 
compressibility in chemistry, rate of growth and blood velocity gradient in biology, marginal 
cost and marginal profit in economics, rate of heat flow in geology, rate of improvement 
of performance in psychology, rate of spread of a rumor in sociology—these are all 
special cases of a single mathematical concept, the derivative. 

This is an illustration of the fact that part of the power of mathematics lies in its 
abstractness. A single abstract mathematical concept (such as the derivative) can have different 
interpretations in each of the sciences. When we develop the properties of the mathematical 
concept once and for all, we can then turn around and apply these results to all of 
the sciences. This is much more efficient than developing properties of special concepts in 
each separate science. The French mathematician Joseph Fourier (1768–1830) put it succinctly: 
“Mathematics compares the most diverse phenomena and discovers the secret 
analogies that unite them.”

SECTION 3.4 DERIVATIVES OF TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS .... 211

See Appendix D. 

Before starting this section, you might need to review the trigonometric functions. In particular, 
it is important to remember that when we talk about the function f defined for all 
real numbers x by 

f x  sin x 

it is understood that sin x means the sine of the angle whose radian measure is x. A similar 
convention holds for the other trigonometric functions cos, tan, csc, sec, and cot. Recall 
from Section 2.5 that all of the trigonometric functions are continuous at every number in 
their domains. 

If we sketch the graph of the function f x  sin x and use the interpretation of f x 
as the slope of the tangent to the sine curve in order to sketch the graph of f  (see Exercise 
16 in Section 2.9), then it looks as if the graph of f  may be the same as the cosine 
curve (see Figure 1 and also page 182).

Two of these four limits are easy to evaluate. Since we regard x as a constant when computing 
a limit as h l 0, we have 

lim sin x  sin x and lim cos x  cos x 

h l 0

Trigonometric functions are often used in modeling real-world phenomena. In particular, 
vibrations, waves, elastic motions, and other quantities that vary in a periodic manner 
can be described using trigonometric functions. In the following example we discuss an 
instance of simple harmonic motion. 

EXAMPLE 3 An object at the end of a vertical spring is stretched 4 cm beyond its rest 
position and released at time t  0. (See Figure 5 and note that the downward direction 
is positive.) Its position at time t is

The speed is  v   4 sin t , which is greatest when  sin t   1, that is, when 
cos t  0. So the object moves fastest as it passes through its equilibrium position 
s  0. Its speed is 0 when sin t  0, that is, at the high and low points. See the graphs 
in Figure 6. 


Our main use for the limit in Equation 2 has been to prove the differentiation formula 
for the sine function. But this limit is also useful in finding certain other trigonometric limits, 
as the following two examples show.

|||| 3.5 The Chain Rule 

Suppose you are asked to differentiate the function 
Fx  sx2  1 
The differentiation formulas you learned in the previous sections of this chapter do not 
enable you to calculate Fx. 


218 .... CHAPTER 3 DIFFERENTIATION RULES 

Observe that F is a composite function. In fact, if we let y  f u  su and let 
|||| See Section 1.3 for a review of u  tx  x2 1, then we can write y  Fx  f tx, that is, F  f  t. We know 
composite functions. 

how to differentiate both f and t, so it would be useful to have a rule that tells us how to 
find the derivative of F  f  t in terms of the derivatives of f and t. 
It turns out that the derivative of the composite function f  t is the product of the deriv-


Resources / Module 4 
/ Trigonometric Models atives of f and t. This fact is one of the most important of the differentiation rules and is 
/ The Chain Rule called the Chain Rule. It seems plausible if we interpret derivatives as rates of change. 
Regard dudx as the rate of change of u with respect to x, dydu as the rate of change of 
y with respect to u, and dydx as the rate of change of y with respect to x. If u changes 
twice as fast as x and y changes three times as fast as u, then it seems reasonable that y 
changes six times as fast as x, and so we expect that

The Chain Rule If f and t are both differentiable and F  f  t is the composite function 
defined by Fx  f tx, then F is differentiable and Fis given by the 
product 

Fx  f txtx. 
In Leibniz notation, if y  f u and u  tx are both differentiable functions, then 
dy dydu

Comments on the Proof of the Chain Rule Let u be the change in u corresponding to a change 
of x in x, that is, 

u  tx x tx 
Then the corresponding change in y is 

y  f u u f u

The only flaw in this reasoning is that in (1) it might happen that u  0 (even when 


SECTION 3.5 THE CHAIN RULE .... 219 

x  0) and, of course, we can’t divide by 0. Nonetheless, this reasoning does at least 
suggest that the Chain Rule is true. A full proof of the Chain Rule is given at the end of 
this section. 


The Chain Rule can be written either in the prime notation 

2 
 f  tx  f txtx 

or, if y  f u and u  tx, in Leibniz notation: 

3 
dy dydu 

dx dudx 

Equation 3 is easy to remember because if dydu and dudx were quotients, then we could 
cancel du. Remember, however, that du has not been defined and dudx should not be 
thought of as an actual quotient. 

EXAMPLE 1 Find Fx if Fx  sx2  1. 

SOLUTION 1 (using Equation 2): At the beginning of this section we expressed F as 
Fx   f  tx  f tx where f u  su and tx  x2  1. Since 

12 

f u  12 u1 
and tx  2x 

2su 

we have Fx  f txtx 
1 x 

  2x  

2sx2  1 sx2  1

du dx 2su 
1 x 

 2x  

2sx2  1 sx2  1 


When using Formula 3 we should bear in mind that dydx refers to the derivative of y 
when y is considered as a function of x (called the derivative of y with respect to x), 
whereas dydu refers to the derivative of y when considered as a function of u (the derivative 
of y with respect to u). For instance, in Example 1, y can be considered as a function 
of x (y  sx2  1) and also as a function of u (y  su). Note that

that we differentiate the outer function f [at the inner function tx] and then we multiply 
by the derivative of the inner function.

The answer can be left as 2sin x cos x or written as sin 2x (by a trigonometric identity 
|||| See Reference Page 2 or Appendix D. known as the double-angle formula). 


In Example 2(a) we combined the Chain Rule with the rule for differentiating the sine 

function. In general, if y  sin u, where u is a differentiable function of x, then, by the 

Chain Rule, 

dy dydu du

d du 

Thus sin u  cos u

In a similar fashion, all of the formulas for differentiating trigonometric functions can 
be combined with the Chain Rule. 

Let’s make explicit the special case of the Chain Rule where the outer function f is a 

power function. If y  tx	n, then we can write y  f u  un where u  tx. By using

EXAMPLE 7 Differentiate y  e.

We can use the Chain Rule to differentiate an exponential function with any base a  0.

This is consistent with the exact formula (6) because ln 2 0.693147. 

In Example 6 in Section 3.3 we considered a population of bacteria cells that doubles 
every hour and saw that the population after t hours is n  n02t, where n0 is the initial population. 
Formula 6 enables us to find the rate of growth of the bacteria population:

The reason for the name “Chain Rule” becomes clear when we make a longer chain by 
adding another link. Suppose that y  f u, u  tx, and x  ht, where f , t, and h are 
differentiable functions. Then, to compute the derivative of y with respect to , we use the

How to Prove the Chain Rule 

Recall that if y  f x and x changes from a to a x, we defined the increment of y as 

y  f a x f a 
According to the definition of a derivative, we have 

y

lim  f a 

x l 0 x 

So if we denote by the difference between the difference quotient and the derivative, 
we obtain 

lim  lim y 
f a f a f a  0 

x l 0 x l 0 x 

y

But  f a ? y  f a x x 

x 

If we define to be 0 when x  0, then becomes a continuous function of x. Thus, 
for a differentiable function f, we can write 

7 
y  f a x x where l 0as x l 0 

and is a continuous function of x. This property of differentiable functions is what 
enables us to prove the Chain Rule. 


224 .... CHAPTER 3 DIFFERENTIATION RULES 

Proof of the Chain Rule Suppose u  tx is differentiable at a and y  f u is differentiable 
at b  ta. If x is an increment in x and u and y are the corresponding increments 
in u and y, then we can use Equation 7 to write 

8 
u  ta x 1 x  ta 1 x 

where 1 l 0 as x l 0. Similarly 

9 
y  f b u 2 u   f b 2  u 

where 2 l 0 as u l 0. If we now substitute the expression for u from Equation 8 
into Equation 9, we get 

y   f b 2 ta 1 x 
y 

so   f b 2 ta 1 

x 

As x l 0, Equation 8 shows that u l 0. So both 1 l 0 and 2 l 0 as x l 0. 
Therefore 

dy y

 lim  lim  f b 2 ta 1 

dx x l 0 x x l 0 

 f bta  f tata 

This proves the Chain Rule.

|||| 3.6 Implicit Differentiation 

The functions that we have met so far can be described by expressing one variable explicitly 
in terms of another variable—for example, 

y  sx3  1 or y  x sin x 

or, in general, y  f x. Some functions, however, are defined implicitly by a relation 
between x and y such as 

1 
x2  y2  25 

or 

2 
x3  y3  6xy 

In some cases it is possible to solve such an equation for y as an explicit function (or several 
functions) of x. For instance, if we solve Equation 1 for y, we get y  s25  x2, 
so two of the functions determined by the implicit Equation l are f x  s25  x2 and 
tx  s25  x2. The graphs of f and t are the upper and lower semicircles of the 
circle x2  y2  25. (See Figure 1.)

It’s not easy to solve Equation 2 for y explicitly as a function of x by hand. (A computer 
algebra system has no trouble, but the expressions it obtains are very complicated.) 
Nonetheless, (2) is the equation of a curve called the folium of Descartes shown in 
Figure 2 and it implicitly defines y as several functions of x. The graphs of three such functions 
are shown in Figure 3. When we say that f is a function defined implicitly by Equation 
2, we mean that the equation 

x3   f x3  6xf x 

is true for all values of x in the domain of f .

Fortunately, we don’t need to solve an equation for y in terms of x in order to find the 
derivative of y. Instead we can use the method of implicit differentiation. This consists of 
differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to x and then solving the resulting 
equation for y. In the examples and exercises of this section it is always assumed that the 
given equation determines y implicitly as a differentiable function of x so that the method 
of implicit differentiation can be applied.

SOLUTION 2 

(b) Solving the equation x2  y2  25, we get y  s25  x2. The point 3, 4 lies on 
the upper semicircle y  s25  x2 and so we consider the function f x  s25  x2.

(a) Find yif x3 y3  6xy. 
(b) Find the tangent to the folium of Descartes x3 y3  6xy at the point 3, 3. 
(c) At what points on the curve is the tangent line horizontal? 
SOLUTION 

(a) Differentiating both sides of x3 y3  6xy with respect to x, regarding y as a function 
of x, and using the Chain Rule on the y3 term and the Product Rule on the 6xy term, 
we get 
3x2 3y2 y 6y 6xy 

or x2 y2 y 2y 2xy

We now solve for y: y2y2xy 2y x2

(b) When x  y  3,

y 1 

32 2  3 

and a glance at Figure 4 confirms that this is a reasonable value for the slope at 3, 3. So 
an equation of the tangent to the folium at 3, 3 is 

y 3  1x 3 or x y  6 

(c) The tangent line is horizontal if y 0. Using the expression for yfrom part (a), 
we see that y 0 when 2y x2  0. Substituting y  21 x2 in the equation of the curve, 
we get 
x3 (12 x2)3  6x(12 x2) 

which simplifies to x6  16x3. So either x  0 or x3  16. If x  161
3  24
3, then 
y  12 28
3   25
3. Thus, the tangent is horizontal at (0, 0) and at 24
3, 25
3 , which 
is approximately (2.5198, 3.1748). Looking at Figure 5, we see that our answer is 
reasonable.

NOTE 3 There is a formula for the three roots of a cubic equation that is like the quadratic 
formula but much more complicated. If we use this formula (or a computer algebra 
system) to solve the equation x3 y3  6xy for y in terms of x, we get three functions 
determined by the equation: 

31 31 

y  f x  s2 x3 s41 x6 8x3 s2 x3 s41 x6 8x3

22 x4 x2 x4 x

(These are the three functions whose graphs are shown in Figure 3.) You can see that the 
method of implicit differentiation saves an enormous amount of work in cases such as this.

Moreover, implicit differentiation works just as easily for equations such as 
y5 3x2 y2 5x4  12 
for which it is impossible to find a similar expression for y in terms of x. 

EXAMPLE 3 Find yif sinx y  y2 cos x.

of x, we get 
cosx y  1 y  2yycos x y2sin x 
(Note that we have used the Chain Rule on the left side and the Product Rule and Chain

shows part of the curve sinx y  y2 cos x. As a check on our calculation, notice that 
y 1 when x  y  0 and it appears from the graph that the slope is approximately 

1 at the origin. 
Orthogonal Trajectories 

Two curves are called orthogonal if at each point of intersection their tangent lines are 
perpendicular. In the next example we use implicit differentiation to show that two families 
of curves are orthogonal trajectories of each other; that is, every curve in one family 
is orthogonal to every curve in the other family. Orthogonal families arise in several areas 
of physics. For example, the lines of force in an electrostatic field are orthogonal to the 
lines of constant potential. In thermodynamics, the isotherms (curves of equal temperature) 
are orthogonal to the flow lines of heat. In aerodynamics, the streamlines (curves of 
direction of airflow) are orthogonal trajectories of the velocity-equipotential curves. 

EXAMPLE 4 The equation

represents a family of hyperbolas. (Different values of the constant c give different 
hyperbolas. See Figure 7.) The equation

represents another family of hyperbolas with asymptotes y  x. Show that every curve 
in the family (3) is orthogonal to every curve in the family (4); that is, the families are 
orthogonal trajectories of each other.

From (5) and (6) we see that at any point of intersection of curves from each family, the 
slopes of the tangents are negative reciprocals of each other. Therefore, the curves intersect 
at right angles; that is, they are orthogonal. 

Derivatives of Inverse Trigonometric Functions 

The inverse trigonometric functions were reviewed in Section 1.6. We discussed their continuity 
in Section 2.5 and their asymptotes in Section 2.6. Here we use implicit differentiation 
to find the derivatives of the inverse trigonometric functions, assuming that these 
functions are differentiable. [In fact, if f is any one-to-one differentiable function, it can 
be proved that its inverse function f 1 is also differentiable, except where its tangents are 
vertical. This is plausible because the graph of a differentiable function has no corner or 
kink and so if we reflect it about y  x, the graph of its inverse function also has no corner 
or kink.]

The graphs of ƒ=x cos x and 
its first and second derivatives 

If f is a differentiable function, then its derivative f 	 is also a function, so f 	 may have a 
derivative of its own, denoted by  f 		  f . This new function f  is called the second 
derivative of f because it is the derivative of the derivative of f . Using Leibniz notation, 
we write the second derivative of y  f x as 

	 
d2

d dy y 

dxdx dx2 

Another notation is f x  D2f x. 

EXAMPLE 1 If f x  x cos x, find and interpret f x. 

SOLUTION Using the Product Rule, we have 

dd 

f 	x  x cos x  cos x x 

dx dx 

 x sin x  cos x 

To find f x we differentiate f 	x: 

d 

f x  x sin x  cos x 

dx 

d dd 

 x sin x  sin x x  cos x 

dx dxdx 

 x cos x  sin x  sin x 

 x cos x  2 sin x 

The graphs of f, f 	, and f  are shown in Figure 1. 

We can interpret f x as the slope of the curve y  f 	x at the point x, f 	x. In 
other words, it is the rate of change of the slope of the original curve y  f x. 

Notice from Figure 1 that f x  0 whenever y  f 	x has a horizontal tangent. 
Also, f x is positive when y  f 	x has positive slope and negative when y  f 	x 
has negative slope. So the graphs serve as a check on our calculations. 

In general, we can interpret a second derivative as a rate of change of a rate of change. 
The most familiar example of this is acceleration, which we define as follows. 

If s  st is the position function of an object that moves in a straight line, we know 
that its first derivative represents the velocity vt of the object as a function of time: 

ds 

vt  s	t  

dt 

The instantaneous rate of change of velocity with respect to time is called the acceleration 
at of the object. Thus, the acceleration function is the derivative of the velocity function 
and is therefore the second derivative of the position function: 

at  v	t  st

(c) The particle speeds up when the velocity is positive and increasing ( v and a are both 
positive) and also when the velocity is negative and decreasing ( v and a are both negative). 
In other words, the particle speeds up when the velocity and acceleration have the 
same sign. (The particle is pushed in the same direction it is moving.) From Figure 2 we 
see that this happens when 1  t  2 and when t  3. The particle slows down when v 
and a have opposite signs, that is, when 0  t  1 and when 2  t  3. Figure 3 summarizes 
the motion of the particle.

|||| The factor 1n occurs in the formula for 

f nx because we introduce another negative 
sign every time we differentiate. Since the successive 
values of 1n are 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 
1, . . . , the presence of 1n indicates that the 
sign changes with each successive derivative. 

The third derivative f  is the derivative of the second derivative: f    f 	. So 
f x can be interpreted as the slope of the curve y  f x or as the rate of change of 
f x. If y  f x, then alternative notations for the third derivative are

The process can be continued. The fourth derivative f  is usually denoted by . In gen-
f n

eral, the nth derivative of f is denoted by and is obtained from f by differentiating n 
times. If y  f x, we write 

dn 

y 

yn  f nx  Dnf x 

dxn 

We can interpret the third derivative physically in the case where the function is the 
position function s  st of an object that moves along a straight line. Because 
s  s	 a	, the third derivative of the position function is the derivative of the acceleration 
function and is called the jerk: 

da d3s 

j  

dt dt3 

Thus, the jerk j is the rate of change of acceleration. It is aptly named because a large jerk 
means a sudden change in acceleration, which causes an abrupt movement in a vehicle.

We see that the successive derivatives occur in a cycle of length 4 and, in particular, 
Dn cos x  cos x whenever n is a multiple of 4. Therefore 
D24 

cos x  cos x 

and, differentiating three more times, we have 

D27 

cos x  sin x 

We have seen that one application of second and third derivatives occurs in analyzing 
the motion of objects using acceleration and jerk. We will investigate another application 
of second derivatives in Exercise 62 and in Section 4.3, where we show how knowledge of 
f  gives us information about the shape of the graph of f. In Chapter 11 we will see how 
second and higher derivatives enable us to represent functions as sums of infinite series.

From (5) and (6) we see that at any point of intersection of curves from each family, the 
slopes of the tangents are negative reciprocals of each other. Therefore, the curves intersect 
at right angles; that is, they are orthogonal. 

Derivatives of Inverse Trigonometric Functions 

The inverse trigonometric functions were reviewed in Section 1.6. We discussed their continuity 
in Section 2.5 and their asymptotes in Section 2.6. Here we use implicit differentiation 
to find the derivatives of the inverse trigonometric functions, assuming that these 
functions are differentiable. [In fact, if f is any one-to-one differentiable function, it can 
be proved that its inverse function f 1 is also differentiable, except where its tangents are 
vertical. This is plausible because the graph of a differentiable function has no corner or 
kink and so if we reflect it about y  x, the graph of its inverse function also has no corner 
or kink.]

The graphs of ƒ=x cos x and

If f is a differentiable function, then its derivative f 	 is also a function, so f 	 may have a 
derivative of its own, denoted by  f 		  f . This new function f  is called the second 
derivative of f because it is the derivative of the derivative of f . Using Leibniz notation, 
we write the second derivative of y  f x as

Another notation is f x  D2f x.

 x cos x  2 sin x 

The graphs of f, f 	, and f  are shown in Figure 1. 

We can interpret f x as the slope of the curve y  f 	x at the point x, f 	x. In 
other words, it is the rate of change of the slope of the original curve y  f x. 

Notice from Figure 1 that f x  0 whenever y  f 	x has a horizontal tangent. 
Also, f x is positive when y  f 	x has positive slope and negative when y  f 	x 
has negative slope. So the graphs serve as a check on our calculations. 

In general, we can interpret a second derivative as a rate of change of a rate of change. 
The most familiar example of this is acceleration, which we define as follows. 

If s  st is the position function of an object that moves in a straight line, we know 
that its first derivative represents the velocity vt of the object as a function of time: 

ds 

vt  s	t  

dt 

The instantaneous rate of change of velocity with respect to time is called the acceleration 
at of the object. Thus, the acceleration function is the derivative of the velocity function 
and is therefore the second derivative of the position function: 

at  v	t  st

(c) The particle speeds up when the velocity is positive and increasing ( v and a are both 
positive) and also when the velocity is negative and decreasing ( v and a are both negative). 
In other words, the particle speeds up when the velocity and acceleration have the 
same sign. (The particle is pushed in the same direction it is moving.) From Figure 2 we 
see that this happens when 1  t  2 and when t  3. The particle slows down when v

|||| The factor 1n occurs in the formula for 

f nx because we introduce another negative 
sign every time we differentiate. Since the successive 
values of 1n are 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 
1, . . . , the presence of 1n indicates that the 
sign changes with each successive derivative. 

The third derivative f  is the derivative of the second derivative: f    f 	. So 
f x can be interpreted as the slope of the curve y  f x or as the rate of change of 
f x. If y  f x, then alternative notations for the third derivative are

yn  f nx  Dnf x

We can interpret the third derivative physically in the case where the function is the 
position function s  st of an object that moves along a straight line. Because 
s  s	 a	, the third derivative of the position function is the derivative of the acceleration 
function and is called the jerk: 

da d3s 

j  

dt dt3 

Thus, the jerk j is the rate of change of acceleration. It is aptly named because a large jerk 
means a sudden change in acceleration, which causes an abrupt movement in a vehicle.

Dn cos x  cos x whenever n is a multiple of 4. Therefore

We have seen that one application of second and third derivatives occurs in analyzing 
the motion of objects using acceleration and jerk. We will investigate another application 
of second derivatives in Exercise 62 and in Section 4.3, where we show how knowledge of 
f  gives us information about the shape of the graph of f. In Chapter 11 we will see how 
second and higher derivatives enable us to represent functions as sums of infinite series.

Building a Better Roller Coaster

slope of the drop . You decide to connect these two straight stretches and

in feet. For the track to be smooth there can’t be abrupt changes in direction, so you want the 
linear segments and to be tangent to the parabola at the transition points and . (See the 
figure.) To simplify the equations, you decide to place the origin at . 
1. (a) Suppose the horizontal distance between and is 100 ft. Write equations in , , and

(b) Solve the equations in part (a) for to find a formula for .

2. The solution in Problem 1 might look smooth, but it might not feel smooth because the 
piecewise defined function [consisting of for , for , and 
for ] doesn’t have a continuous second derivative. So you decide to improve the 
design by using a quadratic function only on the interval 
and connecting it to the linear functions by means of two cubic functions: 
(a) Write a system of equations in 11 unknowns that ensure that the functions and their first 
two derivatives agree at the transition points.

Logarithmic Differentiation 

The calculation of derivatives of complicated functions involving products, quotients, or 
powers can often be simplified by taking logarithms. The method used in the following 
example is called logarithmic differentiation.

Steps in Logarithmic Differentiation 

1. 
Take natural logarithms of both sides of an equation y  fx and use the Laws 
of Logarithms to simplify. 
2. 
Differentiate implicitly with respect to x. 
3. 
Solve the resulting equation for y. 
If fx  0 for some values of x, then ln fx is not defined, but we can write 
	 y	  	 fx	 and use Equation 4. We illustrate this procedure by proving the general version 
of the Power Rule, as promised in Section 3.1.

The Power Rule If n is any real number and fx  x, then 
fx  nxn1

The Number e as a Limit 

We have shown that if f x  ln x, then f x  1x. Thus, f 1  1. We now use this 
fact to express the number e as a limit. 

From the definition of a derivative as a limit, we have 

f 1  h  f 1 f 1  x  f 1

Then, by Theorem 2.5.8 and the continuity of the exponential function, we have

|||| 3.9 Hyperbolic Functions 


Certain combinations of the exponential functions ex and ex arise so frequently in mathematics 
and its applications that they deserve to be given special names. In many ways they 
are analogous to the trigonometric functions, and they have the same relationship to the 
hyperbola that the trigonometric functions have to the circle. For this reason they are collectively 
called hyperbolic functions and individually called hyperbolic sine, hyperbolic 
cosine, and so on.

Exercise 23.) 
Some of the mathematical uses of hyperbolic functions will be seen in Chapter 7. 
Applications to science and engineering occur whenever an entity such as light, velocity, 
electricity, or radioactivity is gradually absorbed or extinguished, for the decay can be represented 
by hyperbolic functions. The most famous application is the use of hyperbolic 
cosine to describe the shape of a hanging wire. It can be proved that if a heavy flexible 
cable (such as a telephone or power line) is suspended between two points at the same 
height, then it takes the shape of a curve with equation called a catenary 
(see Figure 4). (The Latin word catena means “chain.”)

SECTION 3.9 HYPERBOLIC FUNCTIONS .... 251 

The hyperbolic functions satisfy a number of identities that are similar to well-known 
trigonometric identities. We list some of them here and leave most of the proofs to the 
exercises. 

Hyperbolic Identities

(b) We start with the identity proved in part (a): 
cosh2x  sinh2x  1 

If we divide both sides by cosh2x, we get 

sinh2x 1 

1   

cosh2x cosh2x 

or 1  tanh2x  sech2x

The identity proved in Example 1(a) gives a clue to the reason for the name “hyperbolic” 
functions: 

If tis any real number, then the point Pcos t, sin t lies on the unit circle x2  y2  1 
because cos2t  sin2t  1. In fact, t can be interpreted as the radian measure of POQ 
in Figure 5. For this reason the trigonometric functions are sometimes called circular 
functions. 

Likewise, if t is any real number, then the point Pcosh t, sinh t lies on the right branch 
of the hyperbola x2  y2  1 because cosh2t  sinh2t  1 and cosh t  1. This time, t 
does not represent the measure of an angle. However, it turns out that t represents twice 
the area of the shaded hyperbolic sector in Figure 6, just as in the trigonometric case t represents 
twice the area of the shaded circular sector in Figure 5. 

The derivatives of the hyperbolic functions are easily computed. For example, 

˜-¥=1 x xx x

We list the differentiation formulas for the hyperbolic functions as Table 1. The remaining 
proofs are left as exercises. Note the analogy with the differentiation formulas for trigonometric 
functions, but beware that the signs are different in some cases.

Inverse Hyperbolic Functions 

You can see from Figures 1 and 3 that sinh and tanh are one-to-one functions and so they 
have inverse functions denoted by sinh1 and tanh1. Figure 2 shows that cosh is not oneto-
one, but when restricted to the domain 0,  it becomes one-to-one. The inverse hyperbolic 
cosine function is defined as the inverse of this restricted function.

The remaining inverse hyperbolic functions are defined similarly (see Exercise 28). 
We can sketch the graphs of sinh1, cosh1, and tanh1 in Figures 7, 8, and 9 by using 
Figures 1, 2, and 3.

of tanh1x and coth1x appear to be identical. 
But the domains of these functions have no numbers

whereas coth1x is defined for  x   1. 

SECTION 3.9 HYPERBOLIC FUNCTIONS .... 253 

Since the hyperbolic functions are defined in terms of exponential functions, it’s not 
surprising to learn that the inverse hyperbolic functions can be expressed in terms of logarithms. 
In particular, we have: 

543 
sinh1x  ln(x  sx2  1) x   
cosh1x  ln(x  sx2  1) x  1

SOLUTION Let y  sinh1x. Then 

y  ey

2 
so ey  2x  e

y  0 

or, multiplying by ey, 
e2y  2xey  1  0 
This is really a quadratic equation in ey: 
ey 2  2xey   1  0 
Solving by the quadratic formula, we get 
2x  s4x2  4 

ey  x  sx2  1 

2 
Note that ey  0, but x  sx2  1  0 (because x  sx2  1). Thus, the minus sign 
is inadmissible and we have 
ey  x  sx2  1 
Therefore y  lney   ln(x  sx2  1) 
(See Exercise 25 for another method.)

|||| According to the Principles of Problem 
Solving discussed on page 80, the first step is to 
understand the problem. This includes reading 
the problem carefully, identifying the given and 
the unknown, and introducing suitable notation. 

If we are pumping air into a balloon, both the volume and the radius of the balloon are 
increasing and their rates of increase are related to each other. But it is much easier to measure 
directly the rate of increase of the volume than the rate of increase of the radius. 

In a related rates problem the idea is to compute the rate of change of one quantity in 
terms of the rate of change of another quantity (which may be more easily measured). The 
procedure is to find an equation that relates the two quantities and then use the Chain Rule 
to differentiate both sides with respect to time. 

EXAMPLE 1 Air is being pumped into a spherical balloon so that its volume increases at a 
rate of 100 cm3
s. How fast is the radius of the balloon increasing when the diameter is 
50 cm? 

SOLUTION We start by identifying two things: 

the given information: 

the rate of increase of the volume of air is 100 cm3
s 

and the unknown: 

the rate of increase of the radius when the diameter is 50 cm 

In order to express these quantities mathematically, we introduce some suggestive 
notation: 

Let V be the volume of the balloon and let r be its radius. 

The key thing to remember is that rates of change are derivatives. In this problem, the 
volume and the radius are both functions of the time t. The rate of increase of the volume 
with respect to time is the derivative dV
dt, and the rate of increase of the radius is 
dr
dt. We can therefore restate the given and the unknown as follows: 

dV 

Given:  100 cm3
s 

dt 
dr 

Unknown: when r  25 cm

SECTION 3.10 RELATED RATES .... 257 

|||| The second stage of problem solving is to In order to connect dV
dt and dr

think of a plan for connecting the given and the volume of a sphere: 
unknown. 


V  43

In order to use the given information, we differentiate each side of this equation with 
respect to t. To differentiate the right side, we need to use the Chain Rule:

EXAMPLE 2 A ladder 10 ft long rests against a vertical wall. If the bottom of the ladder 
slides away from the wall at a rate of 1 ft
s, how fast is the top of the ladder sliding 
down the wall when the bottom of the ladder is 6 ft from the wall? 

SOLUTION We first draw a diagram and label it as in Figure 1. Let x feet be the distance 
from the bottom of the ladder to the wall and y feet the distance from the top of the 
ladder to the ground. Note that x and y are both functions of t (time). 

We are given that dx
dt  1 ft
s and we are asked to find dy
dt when x  6 ft (see 
Figure 2). In this problem, the relationship between x and y is given by the Pythagorean 
Theorem: 

x2  y2  100 

Differentiating each side with respect to t using the Chain Rule, we have 

dx dy

2x  2y  0 

dt dt 

and solving this equation for the desired rate, we obtain 

dy xdx

dx

EXAMPLE 3 A water tank has the shape of an inverted circular cone with base radius 2 m 
and height 4 m. If water is being pumped into the tank at a rate of 2 m 3
min, find the rate 
at which the water level is rising when the water is 3 m deep. 

SOLUTION We first sketch the cone and label it as in Figure 3. Let V, r, and h be the volume 
of the water, the radius of the surface, and the height at time , where t is measured

t 
in minutes. 

We are given that dV

The quantities V and h are related by the equation

Examples 1–3 that will help us solve future 
problems? 

| WARNING: A common error is to substitute 
the given numerical information (for quantities 
that vary with time) too early. This should 
be done only after the differentiation. (Step 7 
follows Step 6.) For instance, in Example 3 we 
dealt with general values of h until we finally 
substituted h  3 at the last stage. (If we had 
put h  3 earlier, we would have gotten 
dV
dt  0, which is clearly wrong.) 

Strategy It is useful to recall some of the problem-solving principles from page 80 and 
adapt them to related rates in light of our experience in Examples 1–3: 

1. 
Read the problem carefully. 
2. 
Draw a diagram if possible. 
3. 
Introduce notation. Assign symbols to all quantities that are functions of time. 
4. 
Express the given information and the required rate in terms of derivatives. 
5. 
Write an equation that relates the various quantities of the problem. If necessary, use 
the geometry of the situation to eliminate one of the variables by substitution (as in 
Example 3). 
6. 
Use the Chain Rule to differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to t. 
7. 
Substitute the given information into the resulting equation and solve for the 
unknown rate. 
The following examples are further illustrations of the strategy.

|||| 3.11 Linear Approximations and Differentials 

We have seen that a curve lies very close to its tangent line near the point of tangency. In 
Resources / Module 3 fact, by zooming in toward a point on the graph of a differentiable function, we noticed 
/ Linear Approximation 


that the graph looks more and more like its tangent line. (See Figure 2 in Section 2.7 and 

/ Start of Linear Approximation 

Figure 3 in Section 2.8.) This observation is the basis for a method of finding approximate 
values of functions. 
The idea is that it might be easy to calculate a value f a of a function, but difficult (or 

y 

even impossible) to compute nearby values of f. So we settle for the easily computed val-

y=ƒ 

ues of the linear function L whose graph is the tangent line of f at a, f a. (See Figure 1.) 
In other words, we use the tangent line at a, f a as an approximation to the curve 
y=L(x) y  f x when x is near a. An equation of this tangent line is 

{a, f(a)}

and the approximation 

x

f x f a  f ax  a 

is called the linear approximation or tangent line approximation of f at a. The linear 

FIGURE 1 

function whose graph is this tangent line, that is, 

2
Lx  f a  f ax  a 

is called the linearization of f at a. 
The following example is typical of situations in which we use a linear approximation 
to predict the future behavior of a function given by empirical data. 

EXAMPLE 1 Suppose that after you stuff a turkey its temperature is 50F and you then put 
it in a 325F oven. After an hour the meat thermometer indicates that the temperature of 
the turkey is 93F and after two hours it indicates 129F. Predict the temperature of the 
turkey after three hours. 

SOLUTION If Tt represents the temperature of the turkey after t hours, we are given that 
T0  50, T1  93, and T2  129. In order to make a linear approximation with 
a  2, we need an estimate for the derivative T2. Because

SECTION 3.11 LINEAR APPROXIMATIONS AND DIFFERENTIALS .... 263 

we could estimate T2by the difference quotient with t  1: 

T1 T2 93  129 

T2  36 

1  2 1 

This amounts to approximating the instantaneous rate of temperature change by the 
average rate of change between t  1 and t  2, which is 36Fh. With this estimate, the 
linear approximation (1) for the temperature after 3 h is 

T3T2 T23  2 
129  36  1  165 

So the predicted temperature after three hours is 165F. 

We obtain a more accurate estimate for T2by plotting the given data, as in Figure 
2, and estimating the slope of the tangent line at t  2 to be 

T233 
Then our linear approximation becomes 

T3T2 T2 1 129  33  162 

and our improved estimate for the temperature is 162F. 

Because the temperature curve lies below the tangent line, it appears that the actual 
temperature after three hours will be somewhat less than 162F, perhaps closer to 160F. 


EXAMPLE 2 Find the linearization of the function f x sx  3 at a  1 and use it to 
approximate the numbers s3.98 and s4.05. Are these approximations overestimates or 
underestimates? 

SOLUTION The derivative of f x x  312 is 

f x 21 x  312  
1 

2sx  3 

and so we have f 1 2 and f 1 14. Putting these values into Equation 2, we see that 
the linearization is 

17 x 

Lx f 1 f 1x  1 2  4 x  1  

44 

The corresponding linear approximation (1) is 

7 x 

sx  3   (when x is near 1)

44 
In particular, we have 

0.98 1.05
s3.98 74  4  1.995 and s4.05 74  4  2.0125 

The linear approximation is illustrated in Figure 3. We see that, indeed, the tangent 
line approximation is a good approximation to the given function when x is near l. We 
also see that our approximations are overestimates because the tangent line lies above the 
curve. 


264 .... CHAPTER 3 DIFFERENTIATION RULES 

Of course, a calculator could give us approximations for s3.98 and s4.05, but the 
linear approximation gives an approximation over an entire interval. 


In the following table we compare the estimates from the linear approximation in 
Example 2 with the true values. Notice from this table, and also from Figure 3, that the 
tangent line approximation gives good estimates when x is close to 1 but the accuracy of 
the approximation deteriorates when x is farther away from 1.

How good is the approximation that we obtained in Example 2? The next example

which a linear approximation provides a specified accuracy. 

EXAMPLE 3 For what values of x is the linear approximation 

7 x 

sx  3  

accurate to within 0.5? What about accuracy to within 0.1? 
SOLUTION Accuracy to within 0.5 means that the functions should differ by less than 0.5: 


7 x

 sx  3      0.5 

44 

Equivalently, we could write 

7 x 

sx  3  0.5  sx  3  0.5 

44 

This says that the linear approximation should lie between the curves obtained by shifting 
the curve y  sx  3 upward and downward by an amount 0.5. Figure 4 shows 
the tangent line y  7  x4 intersecting the upper curve y  sx  3  0.5 at P 
and Q. Zooming in and using the cursor, we estimate that the x-coordinate of P is about 

2.66 and the x-coordinate of Q is about 8.66. Thus, we see from the graph that the 
approximation 
7 x

is accurate to within 0.5 when 2.6  x  8.6. (We have rounded to be safe.) 

Similarly, from Figure 5 we see that the approximation is accurate to within 0.1 when 
1.1  x  3.9. 



SECTION 3.11 LINEAR APPROXIMATIONS AND DIFFERENTIALS .... 265 

Applications to Physics 

Linear approximations are often used in physics. In analyzing the consequences of an 
equation, a physicist sometimes needs to simplify a function by replacing it with its linear 
approximation. For instance, in deriving a formula for the period of a pendulum, physics 

textbooks obtain the expression aT  t sin 

for tangential acceleration and then replace 

sin 

by 

with the remark that sin 

is very close to 

if 

is not too large. [See, for 

example, Physics: Calculus, 2d ed., by Eugene Hecht (Pacific Grove, CA: Brooks/Cole, 
2000), p. 431.] You can verify that the linearization of the function f x  sin x at a  0 
is Lx  x and so the linear approximation at 0 is 

sin x  x 

(see Exercise 48). So, in effect, the derivation of the formula for the period of a pendulum 
uses the tangent line approximation for the sine function. 

Another example occurs in the theory of optics, where light rays that arrive at shallow 
angles relative to the optical axis are called paraxial rays. In paraxial (or Gaussian) optics, 

both sin 

and 

cos 

are replaced by their linearizations. In other words, the linear approx


imations 

sin 

and cos 

 1 


are used because 

is close to 0. The results of calculations made with these approxima

tions became the basic theoretical tool used to design lenses. [See Optics, 4th ed., by 
Eugene Hecht (Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 2002), p. 154.] 

In Section 11.12 we will present several other applications of the idea of linear approximations 
to physics. 

Differentials 

The ideas behind linear approximations are sometimes formulated in the terminology and 
notation of differentials. If y  f x, where f is a differentiable function, then the differential 
dx is an independent variable; that is, dx can be given the value of any real number. 
The differential dy is then defined in terms of dx by the equation 

3 
dy  f x dx

dx 

We have seen similar equations before, but now 
the left side can genuinely be interpreted as a 

So 

dy is a dependent variable; it depends on the values of x and dx. If dx is given a spe

cific value and x is taken to be some specific number in the domain of f, then the numerical 
value of dy is determined. 

The geometric meaning of differentials is shown in Figure 6. Let Px, f x and 
Qx x, f x x be points on the graph of f and let dx  x. The corresponding 
change in y is 

y  f x x f x 

The slope of the tangent line PR is the derivative f x. Thus, the directed distance from S 
to R is f x dx  dy. Therefore, dy represents the amount that the tangent line rises or 
falls (the change in the linearization), whereas y represents the amount that the curve 

FIGURE 6 y  f x rises or falls when x changes by an amount dx.

Notice that the approximation y dy becomes better as x becomes smaller in 
Example 4. Notice also that dy was easier to compute than y. For more complicated functions 
it may be impossible to compute y exactly. In such cases the approximation by differentials 
is especially useful. 

In the notation of differentials, the linear approximation (1) can be written as 

fa  dxfa dy 

For instance, for the function fx sx  3 in Example 2, we have

and 
s4.05  f1.05f1 dy  2.0125 

just as we found in Example 2. 

Our final example illustrates the use of differentials in estimating the errors that occur 
because of approximate measurements. 

EXAMPLE 5 The radius of a sphere was measured and found to be 21 cm with a possible 
error in measurement of at most 0.05 cm. What is the maximum error in using this value 
of the radius to compute the volume of the sphere? 

V  43

SOLUTION If the radius of the sphere is r, then its volume is 3 r. If the error in the 
measured value of r is denoted by dr  r, then the corresponding error in the calcu



SECTION 3.11 LINEAR APPROXIMATIONS AND DIFFERENTIALS .... 267 

lated value of V is V, which can be approximated by the differential 

2 dr

dV  4	r

When r  21 and dr  0.05, this becomes 

dV  4	2120.05  277 

The maximum error in the calculated volume is about 277 cm . 3 



NOTE Although the possible error in Example 5 may appear to be rather large, a better 
picture of the error is given by the relative error, which is computed by dividing the error 
by the total volume: 

2 dr

Thus, the relative error in the volume is about three times the relative error in the radius. 
In Example 5 the relative error in the radius is approximately drr  0.0521  0.0024 
and it produces a relative error of about 0.007 in the volume. The errors could also be 
expressed as percentage errors of 0.24% in the radius and 0.7% in the volume.

The tangent line approximation Lx is the best first-degree (linear) approximation to f x near 

x  a because f x and Lx have the same rate of change (derivative) at a. For a better approx


imation than a linear one, let’s try a second-degree (quadratic) approximation Px. In other 

words, we approximate a curve by a parabola instead of by a straight line. To make sure that the 

approximation is a good one, we stipulate the following: 

(i) 
Pa  f a (P and f should have the same value at a.) 
(ii) 
Pa  f a (P and f should have the same rate of change at a.) 
(iii) P a  f a (The slopes of P and f should change at the same rate.) 
1. 
Find the quadratic approximation Px  A Bx Cx 2 to the function f x  cos x that 
satisfies conditions (i), (ii), and (iii) with a  0. Graph P, f , and the linear approximation 
Lx  1 on a common screen. Comment on how well the functions P and L approximate f . 
2. 
Determine the values of x for which the quadratic approximation f x  Px in Problem 1 
is accurate to within 0.1. [Hint: Graph y  Px, y  cos x 0.1, and y  cos x 0.1 on 
a common screen.] 
3. 
To approximate a function f by a quadratic function P near a number a, it is best to write P 
in the form 
Px  A Bx a Cx a2 

Show that the quadratic function that satisfies conditions (i), (ii), and (iii) is 

Px  f a f ax a 21 f ax a2

Find the quadratic approximation to f x  sx 3 near a  1. Graph f , the quadratic 
approximation, and the linear approximation from Example 3 in Section 3.11 on a common 
screen. What do you conclude? 
5. 
Instead of being satisfied with a linear or quadratic approximation to f x near x  a, let’s 
try to find better approximations with higher-degree polynomials. We look for an nth-degree 
polynomial

By differentiating repeatedly and setting x  a, show that these conditions are satisfied

EXAMPLE 1 How many lines are tangent to both of the parabolas y  1  x2 and 
y  1  x2? Find the coordinates of the points at which these tangents touch the 
parabolas. 

SOLUTION To gain insight into this problem, it is essential to draw a diagram. So we sketch 
the parabolas y  1  x2 (which is the standard parabola y  x2 shifted 1 unit upward) 
and y  1  x2 (which is obtained by reflecting the first parabola about the x-axis). If 
we try to draw a line tangent to both parabolas, we soon discover that there are only two 
possibilities, as illustrated in Figure 1. 

Let P be a point at which one of these tangents touches the upper parabola and let a 
be its x-coordinate. (The choice of notation for the unknown is important. Of course we 
could have used b or c or x0 or x1 instead of a. However, it’s not advisable to use x in 
place of a because that x could be confused with the variable x in the equation of the 
parabola.) Then, since P lies on the parabola y  1  x2, its y-coordinate must be 1  a2. 
Because of the symmetry shown in Figure 1, the coordinates of the point Q where the 
tangent touches the lower parabola must be a, 1  a2 . 

To use the given information that the line is a tangent, we equate the slope of the line 
PQ to the slope of the tangent line at P. We have 

1  a2  1  a2  1  a2 

mPQ  

a  a a 

If fx  1  x2, then the slope of the tangent line at P is fa  2a. Thus, the condition 
that we need to use is that 

1  a2 

 2a 

a 

Solving this equation, we get 1  a2  2a2, so a2  1 and a  1. Therefore, the 
points are (1, 2) and (1, 2). By symmetry, the two remaining points are (1, 2) 
and (1, 2). 

EXAMPLE 2 For what values of c does the equation ln x  cx2 have exactly one 
solution? 

SOLUTION One of the most important principles of problem solving is to draw a diagram, 
even if the problem as stated doesn’t explicitly mention a geometric situation. Our present 
problem can be reformulated geometrically as follows: For what values of c does 
the curve y  ln x intersect the curve y  cx2 in exactly one point? 

Let’s start by graphing y  ln x and y  cx2 for various values of c. We know that, 
for c  0, y  cx2 is a parabola that opens upward if c  0 and downward if c  0. 
Figure 2 shows the parabolas y  cx2 for several positive values of c. Most of them 
don’t intersect y  ln x at all and one intersects twice. We have the feeling that there 
must be a value of c (somewhere between 0.1 and 0.3) for which the curves intersect 
exactly once, as in Figure 3. 

To find that particular value of c, we let a be the x-coordinate of the single point of 
intersection. In other words, ln a  ca2, so a is the unique solution of the given equation. 
We see from Figure 3 that the curves just touch, so they have a common tangent 


x 
y

line when x  a. That means the curves y  ln x and y  cx2 have the same slope when 
x  a. Therefore

 2ca 

a 
Solving the equations ln a  ca2 and 1a  2ca, we get

ln a  ca2  c   

2c 2 
Thus, a  e12 and 
ln a ln e121 

c   

a2 e 2e 

For negative values of c we have the situation illustrated in Figure 4: All parabolas 
y  cx2 with negative values of c intersect y  ln x exactly once. And let’s not forget 
about c  0: The curve y  0x2  0 is just the x-axis, which intersects y  ln x exactly 

FIGURE 4 once. 
To summarize, the required values of c are c  12e and c 	 0.

Scientists have tried to 
(Chapter)

Aristotle. In the project on 
page 288, you will be able 
to use the principles of 
differential calculus to 
explain the formation, 
location, and colors of 
the rainbow. 

Applications of Differentiation 



We have already investigated some of the applications of 
derivatives, but now that we know the differentiation rules 
we are in a better position to pursue the applications of dif


ferentiation in greater depth. Here we learn how derivatives 
affect the shape of a graph of a function and, in particular, 
how they help us locate maximum and minimum values of functions. Many practical 
problems require us to minimize a cost or maximize an area or somehow find 
the best possible outcome of a situation. In particular, we will be able to investigate 
the optimal shape of a can and to explain the location of rainbows in the sky. 

|||| 4.1 Maximum and Minimum Values 

Some of the most important applications of differential calculus are optimization problems, 
in which we are required to find the optimal (best) way of doing something. Here are 
examples of such problems that we will solve in this chapter: 

 

What is the shape of a can that minimizes manufacturing costs? 

 

What is the maximum acceleration of a space shuttle? (This is an important 
question to the astronauts who have to withstand the effects of acceleration.) 

 

What is the radius of a contracted windpipe that expels air most rapidly during 
a cough? 

 

At what angle should blood vessels branch so as to minimize the energy expended 

by the heart in pumping blood? 
These problems can be reduced to finding the maximum or minimum values of a function. 
Let’s first explain exactly what we mean by maximum and minimum values. 

1 
Definition A function f has an absolute maximum (or global maximum) at c 
if f c  f x for all x in D, where D is the domain of f. The number f c is called 
the maximum value of f on D. Similarly, f has an absolute minimum at c if 
f c  f x for all x in D and the number f c is called the minimum value of f 
on D. The maximum and minimum values of f are called the extreme values of .f 
Figure 1 shows the graph of a function f with absolute maximum at d and absolute 
minimum at a. Note that d, f d is the highest point on the graph and a, f a is the lowest 
point.

In Figure 1, if we consider only values of x near b [for instance, if we restrict our attention 
to the interval a, c], then f b is the largest of those values of f x and is called a 
local maximum value of f . Likewise, f c is called a local minimum value of f because 
f c  f x for x near c [in the interval b, d, for instance]. The function f also has a local 
minimum at e. In general, we have the following definition. 

Definition A function has a local maximum (or relative maximum) at if 
when x is near c. [This means that for all in some open 
interval containing c.] Similarly, has a local minimum at if when

The function f whose graph is shown in Figure 6 is defined on the closed interval [0, 2] 
but has no maximum value. (Notice that the range of f is [0, 3). The function takes on values 
arbitrarily close to 3, but never actually attains the value 3.) This does not contradict 
the Extreme Value Theorem because f is not continuous. [Nonetheless, a discontinuous 
function could have maximum and minimum values. See Exercise 13(b).] 

The function t shown in Figure 7 is continuous on the open interval (0, 2) but has neither 
a maximum nor a minimum value. [The range of t is 1, . The function takes on 
arbitrarily large values.] This does not contradict the Extreme Value Theorem because the 
interval (0, 2) is not closed.

The Extreme Value Theorem says that a continuous function on a closed interval has a 

maximum value and a minimum value, but it does not tell us how to find these extreme 

values. We start by looking for local extreme values. 

Figure 8 shows the graph of a function f with a local maximum at c and a local minimum 
at d. It appears that at the maximum and minimum points the tangent lines are horizontal 
and therefore each has slope 0. We know that the derivative is the slope of the tangent line, 
so it appears that f c  0 and f d  0. The following theorem says that this is always

status, Fermat was one of the two inventors of 
analytic geometry (Descartes was the other). His 
methods for finding tangents to curves and maximum 
and minimum values (before the invention 
of limits and derivatives) made him a forerunner 
of Newton in the creation of differential calculus.

Fermat’s Theorem If has a local maximum or minimum at , and if 
exists, then .f c  0 
f ccf4 
Proof Suppose, for the sake of definiteness, that f has a local maximum at c. Then, 
according to Definition 2, f c  f x if x is sufficiently close to c. This implies that if 
h is sufficiently close to 0, with h being positive or negative, then 

f c  f c  h 

and therefore 

5 
f c  h  f c  0 

We can divide both sides of an inequality by a positive number. Thus, if h 
 0 and h is 
sufficiently small, we have 

f c  h  f c 

 0 

h 

Taking the right-hand limit of both sides of this inequality (using Theorem 2.3.2), we get 

f c  h  f c 

lim  lim 0  0 

h l 0 hh l 0

But since f c exists, we have 

f c  h  f c f c  h  f c 

f c  lim  lim 

h l 0 hh l 0 h 

and so we have shown that f c  0. 
If h 	 0, then the direction of the inequality (5) is reversed when we divide by h: 

f c  h  f c 

 0 h 	 0 

h 

So, taking the left-hand limit, we have 

f c  h  f c f c  h  f c 

f c  lim  lim  0 

h l 0 hh l 0 h 

We have shown that f c  0 and also that f c  0. Since both of these inequalities 
must be true, the only possibility is that f c  0. 

We have proved Fermat’s Theorem for the case of a local maximum. The case of a 
local minimum can be proved in a similar manner, or we could use Exercise 76 to 
deduce it from the case we have just proved (see Exercise 77). 

The following examples caution us against reading too much into Fermat’s Theorem. 
We can’t expect to locate extreme values simply by setting f x  0 and solving for x. 

EXAMPLE 5 If f x  x3, then f x  3x2, so f 0  0. But f has no maximum or minimum 
at 0, as you can see from its graph in Figure 9. (Or observe that x3 
 0 for x 
 0 
but x3 	 0 for x 	 0.) The fact that f 0  0 simply means that the curve y  x3 has a

horizontal tangent at 0, 0. Instead of having a maximum or minimum at 0, 0, the 
curve crosses its horizontal tangent there. 


= 

| Examples 5 and 6 show that we must be careful when using Fermat’s 
Theorem. even when f c  0 there need not be a maximum 
or minimum at c. 
Furthermore, there may be an extreme value even when f c does not exist

To find an absolute maximum or minimum of a continuous function on a closed interval, 
we note that either it is local [in which case it occurs at a critical number by (7)] or it occurs 
at an endpoint of the interval. Thus, the following three-step procedure always works. 

The Closed Interval Method To find the absolute maximum and minimum values of a 
continuous function f on a closed interval a, b: 

1. 
Find the values of f at the critical numbers of f in a, b. 
2. 
Find the values of f at the endpoints of the interval. 
3. 
The largest of the values from Steps 1 and 2 is the absolute maximum value; 
the smallest of these values is the absolute minimum value.

SOLUTION Since f is continuous on [21, 4], we can use the Closed Interval Method:

Since f x exists for all x, the only critical numbers of f occur when f x  0, that is, 
x  0 or x  2. Notice that each of these critical numbers lies in the interval (21, 4). 
The values of f at these critical numbers are 

f 0  1 f 2  3 

The values of f at the endpoints of the interval are 
1)  1

f (28 f 4  17 

Comparing these four numbers, we see that the absolute maximum value is f 4  17 
and the absolute minimum value is f 2  3. 

Note that in this example the absolute maximum occurs at an endpoint, whereas the 

FIGURE 12 absolute minimum occurs at a critical number. The graph of f is sketched in Figure 12. 


If you have a graphing calculator or a computer with graphing software, it is possible 
to estimate maximum and minimum values very easily. But, as the next example shows, 
calculus is needed to find the exact values.

ing the cursor close to the maximum point, we see that the y-coordinates don’t change 

very much in the vicinity of the maximum. The absolute maximum value is about 6.97 

and it occurs when x  5.2. Similarly, by moving the cursor close to the minimum point, 

we see that the absolute minimum value is about 0.68 and it occurs when x  1.0. It is 

possible to get more accurate estimates by zooming in toward the maximum and mini

EXAMPLE 10 The Hubble Space Telescope was deployed on April 24, 1990, by the space 
shuttle Discovery. A model for the velocity of the shuttle during this mission, from liftoff 
at t  0 until the solid rocket boosters were jettisoned at t  126 s, is given by 

vt 0.001302t3  0.09029t2  23.61t  3.083 

(in feet per second). Using this model, estimate the absolute maximum and minimum 
values of the acceleration of the shuttle between liftoff and the jettisoning of the boosters. 

SOLUTION We are asked for the extreme values not of the given velocity function, but 
rather of the acceleration function. So we first need to differentiate to find the acceleration:

We now apply the Closed Interval Method to the continuous function a on the interval 
0  t  126. Its derivative is 
at 0.007812t  0.18058 
The only critical number occurs when at 0:

Evaluating atat the critical number and at the endpoints, we have 
a0 23.61 at121.52 a12662.87 
So the maximum acceleration is about 62.87 fts2 and the minimum acceleration is 
about 21.52 fts2.

73. 
When a foreign object lodged in the trachea (windpipe) forces 
a person to cough, the diaphragm thrusts upward causing an 
increase in pressure in the lungs. This is accompanied by a 
contraction of the trachea, making a narrower channel for the 
expelled air to fl ow through. For a given amount of air to 
escape in a fixed time, it must move faster through the narrower 
channel than the wider one. The greater the velocity 
of the airstream, the greater the force on the foreign object. 
X rays show that the radius of the circular tracheal tube 
contracts to about two-thirds of its normal radius during a 
cough. According to a mathematical model of coughing, the 
velocity v of the airstream is related to the radius r of the 
trachea by the equation 
vr kr0  rr2 12 r0  r  r0 

where k is a constant and r0 is the normal radius of the trachea. 
The restriction on r is due to the fact that the tracheal wall 
stiffens under pressure and a contraction greater than 21 r0 is 
prevented (otherwise the person would suffocate). 

(a) Determine the value of r in the interval [ 21 r0, r0] at which v 
has an absolute maximum. How does this compare with 
experimental evidence? 
(b) What is the absolute maximum value of v on the interval?

The Calculus of Rainbows 
Rainbows are created when raindrops scatter sunlight. They have fascinated mankind since 
ancient times and have inspired attempts at scientific explanation since the time of Aristotle. In 
this project we use the ideas of Descartes and Newton to explain the shape, location, and colors 
of rainbows. 
1. The figure shows a ray of sunlight entering a spherical raindrop at . Some of the light is 
refl ected, but the line shows the path of the part that enters the drop. Notice that the light 
is refracted toward the normal line and in fact Snell’s Law says that ,

of refl ection.) When the ray reaches , part of it is refl ected, but for the time being we are 
more interested in the part that leaves the raindrop at . (Notice that it is refracted away 
from the normal line.) The angle of deviation is the amount of clockwise rotation that

Problem 1 explains the location of the primary rainbow, but how do we explain the colors? 
Sunlight comprises a range of wavelengths, from the red range through orange, yellow, 
green, blue, indigo, and violet. As Newton discovered in his prism experiments of 1666, the 
index of refraction is different for each color. (The effect is called dispersion.) For red light 
the refractive index is k  1.3318 whereas for violet light it is k  1.3435. By repeating the 
calculation of Problem 1 for these values of k, show that the rainbow angle is about 42.3for 
the red bow and 40.6for the violet bow. So the rainbow really consists of seven individual 
bows corresponding to the seven colors.

|||| 4.2 The Mean Value Theorem 


|||| Rolle’s Theorem was first published in 
1691 by the French mathematician Michel Rolle 
(1652–1719) in a book entitled Méthode pour 
résoudre les égalitéz. Later, however, he became 
a vocal critic of the methods of his day and 
attacked calculus as being a “collection of 
ingenious fallacies.” 

We will see that many of the results of this chapter depend on one central fact, which is 
called the Mean Value Theorem. But to arrive at the Mean Value Theorem we first need the 
following result. 

Rolle’s Theorem Let f be a function that satisfies the following three hypotheses: 

1. f is continuous on the closed interval a, b. 
2. f is differentiable on the open interval a, b. 
3. f a  f b. 
Then there is a number c in a, b such that f c  0. 
Before giving the proof let’s take a look at the graphs of some typical functions that satisfy 
the three hypotheses. Figure 1 shows the graphs of four such functions. In each case 
it appears that there is at least one point c, f c on the graph where the tangent is horizontal 
and therefore f c  0. Thus, Rolle’s Theorem is plausible.

CASE II  for some x in (a, b)f(x)> f(a) [as in Figure 1(b) or (c)] 
By the Extreme Value Theorem (which we can apply by hypothesis 1), has a maxi-f 
mum value somewhere in . Since , it must attain this maximum value at f a  f ba, b 
a number in the open interval . Then has a local maximum at and, by hypothcf

CASE III  for some x in (a, b)f(x)< f (a) [as in Figure 1(c) or (d)] 
By the Extreme Value Theorem, has a minimum value in and, since , it f a  f ba, bf 
attains this minimum value at a number in . Again by Fermat’s Theorem.f c  0a, bc 


EXAMPLE 1 Let’s apply Rolle’s Theorem to the position function s  f t of a moving 
object. If the object is in the same place at two different instants t  a and t  b, then 
f a  f b. Rolle’s Theorem says that there is some instant of time t  c between a and 
b when f c  0; that is, the velocity is 0. (In particular, you can see that this is true 
when a ball is thrown directly upward.) 


|||| Figure 2 shows a graph of the function 
f x  x 3  x  1 discussed in Example 2. 
Rolle’s Theorem shows that, no matter how much 
we enlarge the viewing rectangle, we can never 
find a second x-intercept.

|||| The Mean Value Theorem is an example of 
what is called an existence theorem. Like the 
Intermediate Value Theorem, the Extreme Value 
Theorem, and Rolle’s Theorem, it guarantees that 
there exists a number with a certain property, 
but it doesn’t tell us how to find the number. 

SECTION 4.2 THE MEAN VALUE THEOREM .... 291 

EXAMPLE 2 Prove that the equation x3  x  1  0 has exactly one real root. 

SOLUTION First we use the Intermediate Value Theorem (2.5.10) to show that a root exists. 
Let f x  x3  x  1. Then f 0  1  0 and f 1  1  0. Since f is a polynomial, 
it is continuous, so the Intermediate Value Theorem states that there is a number c 
between 0 and 1 such that f c  0. Thus, the given equation has a root. 

To show that the equation has no other real root, we use Rolle’s Theorem and argue by 
contradiction. Suppose that it had two roots a and b. Then f a  0  f b and, since f 
is a polynomial, it is differentiable on a, b and continuous on a, b. Thus, by Rolle’s 
Theorem, there is a number c between a and b such that f c  0. But 

f x  3x2  1  1 for all x 

(since x2  0) so f x can never be 0. This gives a contradiction. Therefore, the equation 
can’t have two real roots. 


Our main use of Rolle’s Theorem is in proving the following important theorem, which 
was first stated by another French mathematician, Joseph-Louis Lagrange. 

The Mean Value Theorem Let be a function that satisfies the following hypotheses: 
1. is continuous on the closed interval . 
2. is differentiable on the open interval . 
Then there is a number in such that 
or, equivalently,

|||| The Mean Value Theorem was first formulated 
by Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736–1813), 
born in Italy of a French father and an Italian 
mother. He was a child prodigy and became a 
professor in Turin at the tender age of 19. 
Lagrange made great contributions to number 
theory, theory of functions, theory of equations, 
and analytical and celestial mechanics. In particular, 
he applied calculus to the analysis of the 
stability of the solar system. At the invitation of 
Frederick the Great, he succeeded Euler at the 
Berlin Academy and, when Frederick died, 
Lagrange accepted King Louis XVI’s invitation to 
Paris, where he was given apartments in the 
Louvre. Despite all the trappings of luxury and 
fame, he was a kind and quiet man, living only 
for science. 

which is the same expression as on the right side of Equation 1. Since f c is the slope of 
the tangent line at the point c, f c, the Mean Value Theorem, in the form given by 
Equation 1, says that there is at least one point Pc, f c on the graph where the slope of 
the tangent line is the same as the slope of the secant line AB. In other words, there is a 
point P where the tangent line is parallel to the secant line AB. 

Proof We apply Rolle’s Theorem to a new function h defined as the difference between 

f and the function whose graph is the secant line AB. Using Equation 3, we see that the 
equation of the line AB can be written as 

f b  f a 

y  f a  x  a 

b  a 

f b  f a 

or as 
y  f a  x  a 

b  a 

So, as shown in Figure 5, 

4
f b  f a 

hx  f x  f a  x  a 

b  a 

First we must verify that h satisfies the three hypotheses of Rolle’s Theorem. 

1. 
The function h is continuous on a, b because it is the sum of f and a first-degree 
polynomial, both of which are continuous. 
2. 
The function h is differentiable on a, b because both f and the first-degree polynomial 
are differentiable. In fact, we can compute h directly from Equation 4: 
f b  f a 

hx  f x  

b  a 

(Note that f a and  f b  f ab  a are constants.) 

f b  f a 

3. ha  f a  f a  a  a  0 
b  a 

f b  f a 

hb  f b  f a  b  a 

b  a 
 f b  f a   f b  f a  0 

Therefore, ha  hb. 

Since h satisfies the hypotheses of Rolle’s Theorem, that theorem says there is a number 
c in a, b such that hc  0. Therefore 

f b  f a 

0  hc  f c  

b  a 

f b  f a 

and so 
f c  

b  a 


EXAMPLE 3 To illustrate the Mean Value Theorem with a specific function, let’s consider 
f x  x3  x, a  0, b  2. Since f is a polynomial, it is continuous and differentiable

1) tells us that at some time between and the instantaneous velocity 
is equal to that average velocity. For instance, if a car traveled 180 km in 2 hours, then 
the speedometer must have read 90 kmh at least once. 
In general, the Mean Value Theorem can be interpreted as saying that there is a number 
at which the instantaneous rate of change is equal to the average rate of change over 
an interval.

The main significance of the Mean Value Theorem is that it enables us to obtain information 
about a function from information about its derivative. The next example provides 
an instance of this principle.

The Mean Value Theorem can be used to establish some of the basic facts of differential 
calculus. One of these basic facts is the following theorem. Others will be found in the 
following sections.

294 .... CHAPTER 4 APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION 

Proof Let x1 and x2 be any two numbers in a, b with x1  x2. Since f is differentiable 
on a, b, it must be differentiable on x1, x2  and continuous on x1, x2 . By applying 
the Mean Value Theorem to f on the interval x1, x2 , we get a number c such that 
x1  c  x2 and 

6 
f x2   f x1  f cx2  x1 

Since f x  0 for all x, we have f c  0, and so Equation 6 becomes 
f x2   f x1  0 or f x2   f x1 
Therefore, f has the same value at any two numbers x1 and x2 in a, b. This means that 
f is constant on a, b. 


7 
Corollary If f x  tx for all x in an interval a, b, then f  t is constant 

on a, b; that is, f x  tx  c where c is a constant. 

Proof Let Fx  f x  tx. Then 
Fx  f x  tx  0 
for all x in a, b. Thus, by Theorem 5, F is constant; that is, f  t is constant.

The domain of f is D  	x 
 x  0 and f x  0 for all x in D. But f is obviously not a 
constant function. This does not contradict Theorem 5 because D is not an interval. Notice 
that f is constant on the interval 0,  and also on the interval , 0.

|||| 4.3 How Derivatives Affect the Shape of a Graph 

Many of the applications of calculus depend on our ability to deduce facts about a function 
f from information concerning its derivatives. Because f x represents the slope of 
the curve y  f x at the point x, f x, it tells us the direction in which the curve proceeds 

y 


at each point. So it is reasonable to expect that information about f x will provide us with 

D 

information about f x. 

B 

What Does f Say about f ? 

To see how the derivative of f can tell us where a function is increasing or decreasing, look 
at Figure 1. (Increasing functions and decreasing functions were defined in Section 1.1.)

x f x  0. Between B and C, the tangent lines have negative slope and so f x  0. Thus, 
it appears that f increases when f x is positive and decreases when f x is negative. To 
FIGURE 1 prove that this is always the case, we use the Mean Value Theorem. 

Increasing/Decreasing Test

the I/D Test. 

(b) If f x  0 on an interval, then f is decreasing on that interval. 
Proof 


Resources / Module 3 (a) Let x1 and x2 be any two numbers in the interval with x1  x2. According to the defi/

/ Increasing-Decreasing Detector 

Because we are given that f x  0, we know that f is differentiable on x1, x2 . So, 
by the Mean Value Theorem there is a number c between x1 and x2 such that

properties of the derivative f  by examining

Equation 1 is positive, and so 

f x2   f x1  0 or f x1  f x2  

This shows that f is increasing. 
Part (b) is proved similarly.

To use the ID Test we have to know where f x  0 and where f x  0. This 
depends on the signs of the three factors of f x, namely, 12x, x  2, and x  1. We 
divide the real line into intervals whose endpoints are the critical numbers 1, 0, and 
2 and arrange our work in a chart. A plus sign indicates that the given expression is positive, 
and a minus sign indicates that it is negative. The last column of the chart gives the 
conclusion based on the ID Test. For instance, f x  0 for 0  x  2, so f is decreasing 
on (0, 2). (It would also be true to say that f is decreasing on the closed interval 0, 2.)

The graph of f shown in Figure 2 confirms the information in the chart. 


Recall from Section 4.1 that if f has a local maximum or minimum at c, then c must be 
a critical number of f (by Fermat’s Theorem), but not every critical number gives rise to a 
maximum or a minimum. We therefore need a test that will tell us whether or not f has a 
local maximum or minimum at a critical number. 

You can see from Figure 2 that f 0  5 is a local maximum value of f because f 
increases on 1, 0 and decreases on 0, 2. Or, in terms of derivatives, f x  0 for 
1  x  0 and f x  0 for 0  x  2. In other words, the sign of f x changes from 
positive to negative at 0. This observation is the basis of the following test. 

The First Derivative Test Suppose that c is a critical number of a continuous 
function .f 

(a) If f  changes from positive to negative at c, then f has a local maximum at c. 
(b) If f  changes from negative to positive at c, then f has a local minimum at c. 
(c) If 
f  does not change sign at c (for example, if f  is positive on both sides of c 
or negative on both sides), then f has no local maximum or minimum at c. 
The First Derivative Test is a consequence of the ID Test. In part (a), for instance, since 
the sign of f x changes from positive to negative at c, f is increasing to the left of c and 
decreasing to the right of c. It follows that f has a local maximum at c.

distinguish between these two types of behavior? In Figure 6 tangents to these curves have 

/ Introduction 

been drawn at several points. In (a) the curve lies above the tangents and f is called concave 
upward on a, b. In (b) the curve lies below the tangents and t is called concave

Definition If the graph of f lies above all of its tangents on an interval I, then it is 
called concave upward on I. If the graph of f lies below all of its tangents on I,it 
is called concave downward on .I 

Figure 7 shows the graph of a function that is concave upward (abbreviated CU) on the 
intervals b, c, d, e, and e, p and concave downward (CD) on the intervals a, b, c, d,

Let’s see how the second derivative helps determine the intervals of concavity. Looking 
at Figure 6(a), you can see that, going from left to right, the slope of the tangent increases. 


300 .... CHAPTER 4 APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION 

This means that the derivative f  is an increasing function and therefore its derivative f 	 
is positive. Likewise, in Figure 6(b) the slope of the tangent decreases from left to right, 
so f  decreases and therefore f 	 is negative. This reasoning can be reversed and suggests 
that the following theorem is true. A proof is given in Appendix F with the help of the 
Mean Value Theorem. 

Concavity Test 

(a) If f 	x  0 for all x in I, then the graph of f is concave upward on I. 
(b) If f 	x  0 for all x in I, then the graph of f is concave downward on I. 
EXAMPLE 4 Figure 8 shows a population graph for Cyprian honeybees raised in an apiary.

SOLUTION By looking at the slope of the curve as t increases, we see that the rate of 
increase of the population is initially very small, then gets larger until it reaches a maximum 
at about t  12 weeks, and decreases as the population begins to level off. As the 
population approaches its maximum value of about 75,000 (called the carrying capacity), 
the rate of increase, Pt, approaches 0. The curve appears to be concave upward on 
(0, 12) and concave downward on (12, 18). 


In Example 4, the population curve changed from concave upward to concave downward 
at approximately the point (12, 38,000). This point is called an inflection point of the 
curve. The significance of this point is that the rate of population increase has its maximum 
value there. In general, an inflection point is a point where a curve changes its direction of 
concavity. 

Definition A point P on a curve y  f x is called an inflection point if f is continuous 
there and the curve changes from concave upward to concave downward or 
from concave downward to concave upward at P. 

For instance, in Figure 7, B, C, D, and P are the points of inflection. Notice that if a 
curve has a tangent at a point of inflection, then the curve crosses its tangent there. 

In view of the Concavity Test, there is a point of inflection at any point where the second 
derivative changes sign.

iii lim f x  2, lim f x  0

SOLUTION Condition (i) tells us that f is increasing on 
, 1 and decreasing on 1, 
. 
Condition (ii) says that f is concave upward on 
, 2 and 2, 
, and concave downward 
on 2, 2. From condition (iii) we know that the graph of f has two horizontal 
asymptotes: y  2 and y  0. 

We first draw the horizontal asymptote y  2 as a dashed line (see Figure 9). We 
then draw the graph of f approaching this asymptote at the far left, increasing to its maximum 
point at x  1 and decreasing toward the x-axis at the far right. We also make sure 
that the graph has inflection points when x  2 and 2. Notice that we made the curve 
bend upward for x 2 and x  2, and bend downward when x is between 2 and 2. 


Another application of the second derivative is the following test for maximum and 
minimum values. It is a consequence of the Concavity Test. 

The Second Derivative Test Suppose f 	 is continuous near c. 

(a) If f c  0 and f 	c  0, then f has a local minimum at c. 
(b) If f c  0 and f 	c  0, then f has a local maximum at c. 
FIGURE 10 

f ·(c)>0, f is concave upward 

For instance, part (a) is true because f 	x  0 near c and so f is concave upward near 

c. This means that the graph of f lies above its horizontal tangent at c and so f has a local 
minimum at c. (See Figure 10.) 
EXAMPLE 6 Discuss the curve y  x4  4x3 with respect to concavity, points of inflection,

f 	x  12x2  24x  12xx  2 

To find the critical numbers we set f x  0 and obtain x  0 and x  3. To use the 
Second Derivative Test we evaluate f 	 at these critical numbers: 

f 	0  0 f 	3  36  0 

Since f 3  0 and f 	3  0, f 3  27 is a local minimum. Since f 	0  0, the 
Second Derivative Test gives no information about the critical number 0. But since 
f x  0 for x  0 and also for 0  x  3, the First Derivative Test tells us that f does 
not have a local maximum or minimum at 0. [In fact, the expression for f x shows that 
f decreases to the left of 3 and increases to the right of 3.]

To find the local extreme values we use the First Derivative Test. Since f  changes 

from negative to positive at 0, f 0  0 is a local minimum. Since f  changes from 

positive to negative at 4, f 4  253 is a local maximum. The sign of f  does not change 

at 6, so there is no minimum or maximum there. (The Second Derivative Test could be 

used at 4, but not at 0 or 6 since f 	 does not exist at either of these numbers.) 

Looking at the expression for f 	x and noting that x43  0 for all x, we have 
f 	x  0 for x  0 and for 0  x  6 and f 	x  0 for x  6. So f is concave downward 
on 
, 0 and 0, 6 and concave upward on 6, 
, and the only inflection point 
is 6, 0. The graph is sketched in Figure 12. Note that the curve has vertical tangents at 
FIGURE 12 0, 0 and 6, 0 because  f x l 
 as x l 0 and as x l 6. 


Since f 	x  0 when x  0 or 2, we divide the real line into intervals with these 
numbers as endpoints and complete the following chart. 

Interval f 	x  12xx  2 Concavity 
(
,0)  upward 
(0, 2)  downward 
(2, 
)  upward 

The point 0, 0 is an inflection point since the curve changes from concave upward to 
concave downward there. Also 2, 16 is an inflection point since the curve changes 
from concave downward to concave upward there. 

Using the local minimum, the intervals of concavity, and the inflection points, we 
sketch the curve in Figure 11.

NOTE The Second Derivative Test is inconclusive when f 	c  0. In other words, at 
such a point there might be a maximum, there might be a minimum, or there might be neither 
(as in Example 6). This test also fails when f 	c does not exist. In such cases the First 
Derivative Test must be used. In fact, even when both tests apply, the First Derivative Test 
is often the easier one to use.

Since e 0 and x4  0, we have f 	x  0 when x 2 x  0 and f 	x  0 
when x 12. So the curve is concave downward on (
, 12) and concave upward on 
(21, 0) and on 0, 
. The inflection point is (21, e2). 

To sketch the graph of f we first draw the horizontal asymptote y  1 (as a dashed 
line), together with the parts of the curve near the asymptotes in a preliminary sketch 
[Figure 13(a)]. These parts reflect the information concerning limits and the fact that f is 
decreasing on both 
, 0 and 0, 
. Notice that we have indicated that f x l 0 as 
x l 0 even though f 0 does not exist. In Figure 13(b) we finish the sketch by incorporating 
the information concerning concavity and the inflection point. In Figure 13(c) we 
check our work with a graphing device.

|||| 4.4 Indeterminate Forms and L’Hospital’s Rule 

Suppose we are trying to analyze the behavior of the function 

ln x 

Fx  

x 1 

Although F is not defined when x  1, we need to know how F behaves near 1. In particular, 
we would like to know the value of the limit 

1
ln x 

lim 

x l1 x 1 

In computing this limit we can’t apply Law 5 of limits (the limit of a quotient is the quotient 
of the limits, see Section 2.3) because the limit of the denominator is 0. In fact, 
although the limit in (1) exists, its value is not obvious because both numerator and denominator 
approach 0 and 00 is not defined. 

In general, if we have a limit of the form 

f x 

lim 

x l a tx 

where both f x l 0 and tx l 0 as x l a, then this limit may or may not exist and is 
called an indeterminate form of type 00 . We met some limits of this type in Chapter 2. For 
rational functions, we can cancel common factors: 

x2 xxx 1 x 1 

lim  lim  lim  

x l1 x2 1 x l1 x 1x 1 x l1 x 12 

We used a geometric argument to show that 

sin x 

lim  1 

x l 0 x 

But these methods do not work for limits such as (1), so in this section we introduce a systematic 
method, known as l’Hospital’s Rule, for the evaluation of indeterminate forms.

FIGURE 1 

|||| Figure 1 suggests visually why l’Hospital’s 
Rule might be true. The first graph shows two 
differentiable functions f and t, each of which 
approaches 0 as x l a. If we were to zoom in 
toward the point a, 0, the graphs would start 
to look almost linear. But if the functions actually 
were linear, as in the second graph, then their 
ratio would be 

m1x  a m1 

m2x  a m2 

which is the ratio of their derivatives. This suggests 
that 

f x f x 

lim  lim 

x l a tx x l a tx 

Another situation in which a limit is not obvious occurs when we look for a horizontal 
asymptote of F and need to evaluate the limit 

2 
ln x 

lim 

x l  x  1 

It isn’t obvious how to evaluate this limit because both numerator and denominator become 
large as x l . There is a struggle between numerator and denominator. If the numerator 
wins, the limit will be ; if the denominator wins, the answer will be 0. Or there may be 
some compromise, in which case the answer may be some finite positive number. 

In general, if we have a limit of the form 

f x 

lim 

x l a tx 

where both f x l  (or ) and tx l  (or ), then the limit may or may not exist 
and is called an indeterminate form of type . We saw in Section 2.6 that this type of 
limit can be evaluated for certain functions, including rational functions, by dividing 
numerator and denominator by the highest power of x that occurs in the denominator. For 
instance,

This method does not work for limits such as (2), but l’Hospital’s Rule also applies to this 
type of indeterminate form. 

L’Hospital’s Rule Suppose f and t are differentiable and tx  0 near a (except 
possibly at a). Suppose that 

lim f x  0 and lim tx  0

x l ax l a 

or that lim f x  and lim tx  

x l ax l a 

(In other words, we have an indeterminate form of type 00or .) Then 
f x f x 

lim  lim 

x l a tx x l a tx 

if the limit on the right side exists (or is  or ). 



NOTE 1 L’Hospital’s Rule says that the limit of a quotient of functions is equal to the 
limit of the quotient of their derivatives, provided that the given conditions are satisfied. It 
is especially important to verify the conditions regarding the limits of f and t before using 
l’Hospital’s Rule. 



NOTE 2 L’Hospital’s Rule is also valid for one-sided limits and for limits at infinity or 
negative infinity; that is, “ x l a” can be replaced by any of the symbols x l a , x l a , 
x l , or x l . 



NOTE 3 For the special case in which f a  ta  0, f  and t are continuous, and 
ta  0, it is easy to see why l’Hospital’s Rule is true. In fact, using the alternative form 


|||| L’Hospital’s Rule is named after a 
French nobleman, the Marquis de l’Hospital 
(1661–1704), but was discovered by a Swiss 
mathematician, John Bernoulli (1667–1748). 
See Exercise 71 for the example that the 
Marquis used to illustrate his rule. See the 
project on page 315 for further historical details. 

| Notice that when using l’Hospital’s Rule we 
differentiate the numerator and denominator 
separately. We do not use the Quotient Rule. 

|||| The graph of the function of Example 2 is 
shown in Figure 2. We have noticed previously 
that exponential functions grow far more rapidly 
than power functions, so the result of Example 2 
is not unexpected. See also Exercise 67.

that this ratio approaches 0 as x l . See

Notice that the limit on the right side is now indeterminate of type 00. But instead of 
applying l’Hospital’s Rule a second time as we did in Example 2, we simplify the 
expression and see that a second application is unnecessary:

We can evaluate this last limit either by using l’Hospital’s Rule a third time or by 
writing tan xas sin xcos x and making use of our knowledge of trigonometric limits.

Example 5 shows what can go wrong if you use l’Hospital’s Rule without thinking. 
Other limits can be found using l’Hospital’s Rule but are more easily found by other methods. 
(See Examples 3 and 5 in Section 2.3, Example 3 in Section 2.6, and the discussion 
at the beginning of this section.) So when evaluating any limit, you should consider other 
methods before using l’Hospital’s Rule. 

Indeterminate Products 

If limx l af x  0 and limx l a tx   (or ), then it isn’t clear what the value of 
limx l af xtx, if any, will be. There is a struggle between f and t. If f wins, the answer 
will be 0; if t wins, the answer will be  (or ). Or there may be a compromise where 
the answer is a finite nonzero number. This kind of limit is called an indeterminate form 
of type 0 . We can deal with it by writing the product ft as a quotient: 

f t 

ft  or ft  

1t 1f 

This converts the given limit into an indeterminate form of type 00 or  so that we can 
use l’Hospital’s Rule. 

EXAMPLE 6 Evaluate lim x ln x. 

x l 0 

|||| Figure 5 shows the graph of the function in SOLUTION The given limit is indeterminate because, as x l 0, the first factor x 

Example 6. Notice that the function is undefined approaches 0 while the second factor ln x approaches . Writing x  11x, we 
at x  0; the graph approaches the origin but 

have 1x l  as x l 0, so l’Hospital’s Rule gives 

never quite reaches it.

y=x ln x 
This gives an indeterminate form of the type 00, but if we apply l’Hospital’s Rule we get 

a more complicated expression than the one we started with. In general, when we rewrite 
an indeterminate product, we try to choose the option that leads to the simpler limit. 

FIGURE 5 

Indeterminate Differences 

If limx l af x   and limx l a tx  , then the limit 
lim  f x  tx 

x l a 

is called an indeterminate form of type . Again there is a contest between f and 
t. Will the answer be  ( f wins) or will it be  (t wins) or will they compromise on a 
finite number? To find out, we try to convert the difference into a quotient (for instance, 


312 .... CHAPTER 4 APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION 

by using a common denominator, or rationalization, or factoring out a common factor) so 
that we have an indeterminate form of type 00 or . 

EXAMPLE 7 Compute lim sec x  tan x.

SOLUTION 

First notice that sec x l  and tan x l  

as

. 


Indeterminate Powers 

Several indeterminate forms arise from the limit 
lim  f xtx 

x l a 

1. lim f x  0 and lim tx  0 type 00 
x l ax l a 

2. lim f x   and lim tx  0 type 0 
x l ax l a 

1

3. lim f x  1 and lim tx   type 
x l ax l a 

Each of these three cases can be treated either by taking the natural logarithm: 
let y   f xtx , then ln y  tx ln f x 
or by writing the function as an exponential: 

tx ln f x

 f xtx  e

(Recall that both of these methods were used in differentiating such functions.) In either 
method we are led to the indeterminate product tx ln f x, which is of type 0  . 

EXAMPLE 8 Calculate lim 1  sin 4xcot x . 

x l 0 

SOLUTION First notice that as x l 0, we have 1  sin 4x l 1 and cot x l , so the 
given limit is indeterminate. Let 

y  1  sin 4xcot x 

Then ln y  ln1  sin 4xcot x   cot x ln1  sin 4x

the book Analyse des Infiniment Petits published by the 
Marquis de l’Hospital in 1696. This was the first calculus 
textbook ever published and the example that the Marquis 
used in that book to illustrate his rule was to find the limit

The Origins of L’Hospital’s Rule 
L’Hospital’s Rule was first published in 1696 in the Marquis de l’Hospital’s calculus textbook 
Analyse des Infiniment Petits, but the rule was discovered in 1694 by the Swiss mathematician 
John (Johann) Bernoulli. The explanation is that these two mathematicians had entered into a 
curious business arrangement whereby the Marquis de l’Hospital bought the rights to Bernoulli’s 
mathematical discoveries. The details, including a translation of l’Hospital’s letter to Bernoulli 
proposing the arrangement, can be found in the book by Eves [1]. 
Write a report on the historical and mathematical origins of l’Hospital’s Rule. Start by providing 
brief biographical details of both men (the dictionary edited by Gillispie [2] is a good 
source) and outline the business deal between them. Then give l’Hospital’s statement of his rule, 
which is found in Struik’s sourcebook [4] and more briefly in the book of Katz [3]. Notice that 
l’Hospital and Bernoulli formulated the rule geometrically and gave the answer in terms of differentials. 
Compare their statement with the version of l’Hospital’s Rule given in Section 4.4 and 
show that the two statements are essentially the same.

|||| 4.5 Summary of Curve Sketching 

So far we have been concerned with some particular aspects of curve sketching: domain, 
range, and symmetry in Chapter 1; limits, continuity, and asymptotes in Chapter 2; derivatives 
and tangents in Chapters 2 and 3; and extreme values, intervals of increase and 
decrease, concavity, points of inflection, and l’Hospital’s Rule in this chapter. It is now 
time to put all of this information together to sketch graphs that reveal the important features 
of functions. 

You may ask: What is wrong with just using a calculator to plot points and then joining 
these points with a smooth curve? To see the pitfalls of this approach, suppose you have 
used a calculator to produce the table of values and corresponding points in Figure 1.

You might then join these points to produce the curve shown in Figure 2, but the cor


| rect graph might be the one shown in Figure 3. You can see the drawbacks of the method 
of plotting points. Certain essential features of the graph may be missed, such as the maximum 
and minimum values between 2 and 1 or between 2 and 5. If you just plot points, 
you don’t know when to stop. (How far should you plot to the left or right?) But the use 
of calculus ensures that all the important aspects of the curve are illustrated.

You might respond: Yes, but what about graphing calculators and computers? Don’t 

they plot such a huge number of points that the sort of uncertainty demonstrated by Fig


ures 2 and 3 is unlikely to happen? 

It’s true that modern technology is capable of producing very accurate graphs. But even 
the best graphing devices have to be used intelligently. We saw in Section 1.4 that it is 
extremely important to choose an appropriate viewing rectangle to avoid getting a misleading 
graph. (See especially Examples 1, 3, 4, and 5 in that section.) The use of calculus

SECTION 4.5 SUMMARY OF CURVE SKETCHING .... 317 

enables us to discover the most interesting aspects of graphs and in many cases to calculate 
maximum and minimum points and inflection points exactly instead of approximately. 

For instance, Figure 4 shows the graph of f x  8x3  21x2  18x  2. At first 
glance it seems reasonable: It has the same shape as cubic curves like y  x3, and it 
appears to have no maximum or minimum point. But if you compute the derivative, you 
will see that there is a maximum when x  0.75 and a minimum when x  1. Indeed, if 
we zoom in to this portion of the graph, we see that behavior exhibited in Figure 5. Without 
calculus, we could easily have overlooked it. 

In the next section we will graph functions by using the interaction between calculus 
and graphing devices. In this section we draw graphs by first considering the following 
information. We don’t assume that you have a graphing device, but if you do have one you 
should use it as a check on your work. 

Guidelines for Sketching a Curve 

The following checklist is intended as a guide to sketching a curve y  f x by hand. Not 

every item is relevant to every function. (For instance, a given curve might not have an 

6 

asymptote or possess symmetry.) But the guidelines provide all the information you need 

to make a sketch that displays the most important aspects of the function. 

FIGURE 5 

A. Domain 
It’s often useful to start by determining the domain D of f , that is, the set of values 
of x for which f x is defined. 
B. Intercepts 
The y-intercept is f 0 and this tells us where the curve intersects the y-axis. 
To find the x-intercepts, we set y  0 and solve for x. (You can omit this step if the 
y 


equation is difficult to solve.) 

C. Symmetry 
(i) If f x  f x for all x in D, that is, the equation of the curve is unchanged 
when x is replaced by x, then f is an even function and the curve is symmetric about 
0 

x 
the y-axis. This means that our work is cut in half. If we know what the curve looks like 
for x  0, then we need only reflect about the y-axis to obtain the complete curve [see 
(a) Even function: reflectional symmetry Figure 6(a)]. Here are some examples: y  x2, y  x4, y  
 x 
, and y  cos x. 

(ii) If f x  f x for all x in D, then f is an odd function and the curve is 
symmetric about the origin. Again we can obtain the complete curve if we know what 
it looks like for x  0. [Rotate 180° about the origin; see Figure 6(b).] Some simple 
examples of odd functions are y  x, y  x3, y  x5, and y  sin x. 
x 
y 
0 
(iii) If f x  p  f x for all x in D, where p is a positive constant, then f is called 
a periodic function and the smallest such number p is called the period. For instance, 
y  sin x has period 

2.


and has period

y  tan x 

. If we know what the graph looks 
(b) Odd function: rotational symmetry 
like in an interval of length p, then we can use translation to sketch the entire graph (see 

FIGURE 6 
Figure 7).

D. Asymptotes 
(i) Horizontal Asymptotes. Recall from Section 2.6 that if either limx l  f x  L 
or limx l f x  L, then the line y  L is a horizontal asymptote of the curve 

318 .... CHAPTER 4 APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION 

y  f x. If it turns out that limx l  f x   (or ), then we do not have an asymptote 
to the right, but that is still useful information for sketching the curve. 

(ii) Vertical Asymptotes. Recall from Section 2.2 that the line x  a is a vertical 
asymptote if at least one of the following statements is true: 
1
lim f x   lim f x   

x l a. 
x l a 

lim f x   lim f x  

x l a. 
x l a 

(For rational functions you can locate the vertical asymptotes by equating the denominator 
to 0 after canceling any common factors. But for other functions this method does 
not apply.) Furthermore, in sketching the curve it is very useful to know exactly which 
of the statements in (1) is true. If f ais not defined but a is an endpoint of the domain 
of f , then you should compute limx l a f x or limx l a	 f x, whether or not this limit 
is infinite. 

(iii) Slant Asymptotes. These are discussed at the end of this section. 
E. 
Intervals of Increase or Decrease Use the I/D Test. Compute f x and find the intervals 
on which f x is positive ( f is increasing) and the intervals on which f x is negative 
( f is decreasing). 
F. 
Local Maximum and Minimum Values Find the critical numbers of f [the numbers c where 
f c  0 or f c does not exist]. Then use the First Derivative Test. If f  changes from 
positive to negative at a critical number c, then f c is a local maximum. If f  changes 
from negative to positive at c, then f c is a local minimum. Although it is usually 
preferable to use the First Derivative Test, you can use the Second Derivative Test if c 
is a critical number such that f c  0. Then f c  0 implies that f c is a local 
minimum, whereas f c  0 implies that f c is a local maximum. 
G. Concavity and Points of Inflection 
Compute f x and use the Concavity Test. The curve is 
concave upward where f x  0 and concave downward where f x  0. Inflection 
points occur where the direction of concavity changes. 
H. 
Sketch the Curve Using the information in items A–G, draw the graph. Sketch the asymptotes 
as dashed lines. Plot the intercepts, maximum and minimum points, and inflection 
points. Then make the curve pass through these points, rising and falling according to 
In Module 4.5 you can practice using 

E, with concavity according to G, and approaching the asymptotes. If additional accu


information about f , f , and asymptotes 
to determine the shape of the racy is desired near any point, you can compute the value of the derivative there. The 

graph of f . 
tangent indicates the direction in which the curve proceeds.

Since the denominator is 0 when x  1, we compute the following limits:

lim   lim  

x l 1	 x2  1 x l 1 x2  1 

Therefore, the lines x  1and x  1 are vertical asymptotes. This information 
about limits and asymptotes enables us to draw the preliminary sketch in Figure 8, 
showing the parts of the curve near the asymptotes.

Since f x  0 when x  0 x  1 and f x  0 when x  0 x  1, f is 
increasing on , 1 and 1, 0 and decreasing on 0, 1 and 1, . 


F. 
The only critical number is x  0. Since f  changes from positive to negative at 0, 
f 0  0 is a local maximum by the First Derivative Test.

f x  0 &? x2  1  0 &?  x   1 

and f x  0 &?  x   1. Thus, the curve is concave upward on the intervals 
, 1 and 1,  and concave downward on 1, 1. It has no point of inflection 
since 1 and 1 are not in the domain of f .

We see that f x  0 when x  0 (notice that 34 is not in the domain of f ), so the 
only critical number is 0. Since f x  0 when 1  x  0 and f x  0 when 
x  0, f is decreasing on 1, 0 and increasing on 0, . 

F. 
Since f 0  0 and f  changes from negative to positive at 0, f 0  0 is a local 
(and absolute) minimum by the First Derivative Test.

Note that the denominator is always positive. The numerator is the quadratic

which is negative, and the coefficient of x2 is positive. Thus, f x  0 for all x in the

Because both x and ex become large as x l , we have limx l  xex  . As x l , 
however, ex l 0 and so we have an indeterminate product that requires the use of

Since eis always positive, we see that fx  0 when x 	 1  0, and fx  0 when

We know that ln 1  loge 1  0 (since e0  1), so we have 4  x2  1 ? x2  3 
and therefore the x-intercepts are s3. 

C. 
Since f x  f x, f is even and the curve is symmetric about the y-axis. 
D. 
We look for vertical asymptotes at the endpoints of the domain. Since 4  x2 l 0	 as 
x l 2 and also as x l 2	, we have

Some curves have asymptotes that are oblique, that is, neither horizontal nor vertical. If 

lim  f x  mx 	 b	  0 

x l  

then the line y  mx 	 b is called a slant asymptote because the vertical distance 
between the curve y  f x and the line y  mx 	 b approaches 0, as in Figure 16. (A 
similar situation exists if we let x l .) For rational functions, slant asymptotes occur 
when the degree of the numerator is one more than the degree of the denominator. In such 
a case the equation of the slant asymptote can be found by long division as in the following 
example.

Since f x  f x, f is odd and its graph is symmetric about the origin. 
D. 
Since x2 	 1 is never 0, there is no vertical asymptote. Since f x l  as x l  and 
f x l  as x l , there is no horizontal asymptote. But long division gives

|||| If you have not already read Section 1.4, you The method we used to sketch curves in the preceding section was a culmination of much 
should do so now. In particular, it explains how 

of our study of differential calculus. The graph was the final object that we produced. In

to avoid some of the pitfalls of graphing devices 

this section our point of view is completely different. Here we start with a graph produced

by choosing appropriate viewing rectangles. 

by a graphing calculator or computer and then we refine it. We use calculus to make sure 
that we reveal all the important aspects of the curve. And with the use of graphing devices 
we can tackle curves that would be far too complicated to consider without technology. 
The theme is the interaction between calculus and calculators. 

54. 
Coulomb’s Law states that the force of attraction between two 
charged particles is directly proportional to the product of the 
charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance 
between them. The figure shows particles with charge 1 located 
at positions 0 and 2 on a coordinate line and a particle with 
charge 1 at a position x between them. It follows from 
Coulomb’s Law that the net force acting on the middle particle 
is

and we say that the curve y  f  x is asymptotic to the 
parabola y  x 2. Use this fact to help sketch the graph of f

SOLUTION If we specify a domain but not a range, many graphing devices will deduce a 
suitable range from the values computed. Figure 1 shows the plot from one such device 
if we specify that . Although this viewing rectangle is useful for showing 
that the asymptotic behavior (or end behavior) is the same as for , it is obviously 
hiding some finer detail. So we change to the viewing rectangle by 
shown in Figure 2. 
From this graph it appears that there is an absolute minimum value of about 3 
when (by using the cursor) and is decreasing on and increasing 
on . Also there appears to be a horizontal tangent at the origin and inflection 
points when and when is somewhere between and . 
Now let’s try to confirm these impressions using calculus. We differentiate and get

to negative when and from negative to positive when . This means 
that has a local maximum at 0 and a local minimum when , but these were 
hidden in Figure 2. Indeed, if we now zoom in toward the origin in Figure 4, we see

What about concavity and inflection points? From Figures 2 and 4 there appear to be 
inflection points when is a little to the left of and when is a little to the right of 0. 
But it’s difficult to determine inflection points from the graph of , so we graph the second 
derivative in Figure 5. We see that changes from positive to negative when 
and from negative to positive when . So, correct to two decimal 
places, is concave upward on and and concave downward on 
. The inflection points are and . 
We have discovered that no single graph reveals all the important features of this 
polynomial. But Figures 2 and 4, when taken together, do provide an accurate picture.

the maximum and minimum values and the intervals of concavity. Then use calculus to 
find these quantities exactly. 

SOLUTION Figure 6, produced by a computer with automatic scaling, is a disaster. Some 
graphing calculators use 10, 10	 by 10, 10	 as the default viewing rectangle, so 
let’s try it. We get the graph shown in Figure 7; it’s a major improvement.

Figure 7 also allows us to estimate the x-intercepts: about 0.5 and 6.5. The 
exact values are obtained by using the quadratic formula to solve the equation 
x2 	 7x 	 3  0; we get x  (7  s37)2. 

To get a better look at horizontal asymptotes, we change to the viewing rectangle 

20, 20	 by 5, 10	 in Figure 8. It appears that y  1 is the horizontal asymptote and 
this is easily confirmed:

To estimate the minimum value we zoom in to the viewing rectangle 3, 0	 by 
4, 2	 in Figure 9. The cursor indicates that the absolute minimum value is about 3.1 
when x  0.9, and we see that the function decreases on , 0.9 and 0,  and 

FIGURE 8 

increases on 0.9, 0. The exact values are obtained by differentiating:

This shows that f x  0 when 76  x  0 and f x  0 when x 76 and when 

6 37 

x  0. The exact minimum value is f (7)  12  3.08. 

Figure 9 also shows that an inflection point occurs somewhere between x  1 and 
x  2. We could estimate it much more accurately using the graph of the second derivative, 
but in this case it’s just as easy to find exact values. Since 

FIGURE 9 

1418 7x 	 9 

f x  	  2

34 4

we see that f x  0 when x 97 x  0. So f is concave upward on (79, 0) and 

9 971

0,  and concave downward on (, 7 ). The inflection point is (7, 27). 
The analysis using the first two derivatives shows that Figures 7 and 8 display all the 
major aspects of the curve.

SOLUTION Drawing on our experience with a rational function in Example 2, let’s start by 
graphing f in the viewing rectangle 10, 10	 by 10, 10	. From Figure 10 we have 
the feeling that we are going to have to zoom in to see some finer detail and also zoom 
out to see the larger picture. But, as a guide to intelligent zooming, let’s first take a close 
look at the expression for f x. Because of the factors x  22 and x  44 in the 
denominator, we expect x  2 and x  4 to be the vertical asymptotes. Indeed 

x2x 	 13 x2x 	 13 

lim   and lim   

x l2 x  22x  44 x l 4 x  22x  44 

To find the horizontal asymptotes we divide numerator and denominator by x6:

24


1  2

xx 

so the x-axis is the horizontal asymptote. 

It is also very useful to consider the behavior of the graph near the x-intercepts using 
an analysis like that in Example 11 in Section 2.6. Since x2 is positive, f x does not 
change sign at 0 and so its graph doesn’t cross the x-axis at 0. But, because of the factor 
x 	 13, the graph does cross the x-axis at 1 and has a horizontal tangent there. 
Putting all this information together, but without using derivatives, we see that the curve 
has to look something like the one in Figure 11. 

Now that we know what to look for, we zoom in (several times) to produce the graphs 
in Figures 12 and 13 and zoom out (several times) to get Figure 14.

We can read from these graphs that the absolute minimum is about 0.02 and occurs 
when x  20. There is also a local maximum 0.00002 when x  0.3 and a local 
minimum 211 when x  2.5. These graphs also show three inflection points near 35, 
5, and 1 and two between 1 and 0. To estimate the inflection points closely we 
would need to graph f , but to compute f  by hand is an unreasonable chore. If you 
have a computer algebra system, then it’s easy to do (see Exercise 17). 

We have seen that, for this particular function, three graphs (Figures 12, 13, and 14) 
are necessary to convey all the useful information. The only way to display all these 
features of the function on a single graph is to draw it by hand. Despite the exaggerations 
and distortions, Figure 11 does manage to summarize the essential nature of the 
function.

Our final example is concerned with families of functions. As discussed in Section 1.4, 
this means that the functions in the family are related to each other by a formula that 
contains one or more arbitrary constants. Each value of the constant gives rise to a member 
of the family and the idea is to see how the graph of the function changes as the constant 
changes.

EXAMPLE 5 How does the graph of f x  1x2  2x  c vary as c varies? 

SOLUTION The graphs in Figures 19 and 20 (the special cases c  2 and c  2) show 
two very different-looking curves. Before drawing any more graphs, let’s see what members 
of this family have in common. Since 

1 

lim  0 

x l
 x2  2x  c 

for any value of c, they all have the x-axis as a horizontal asymptote. A vertical asymptote 
will occur when x2  2x  c  0. Solving this quadratic equation, we get 
x  1  s1  c. When c 	 1, there is no vertical asymptote (as in Figure 19). When 
c  1, the graph has a single vertical asymptote x  1 because 

11 

lim  lim  
 

x l1 x2  2x  1 x l1 x  12 

When c  1, there are two vertical asymptotes: x  1  s1  c (as in Figure 20). 
Now we compute the derivative: 
2x  2 

f x   

x2  2x  c2 

This shows that f x  0 when x  1 (if c  1), f x 	 0 when x 1, and 

f x  0 when x 	1. For c  1, this means that f increases on 
, 1 and 
decreases on 1, 
. For c 	 1, there is an absolute maximum value 

f 1  1c  1. For c  1, f 1  1c  1 is a local maximum value and the 
intervals of increase and decrease are interrupted at the vertical asymptotes. 

Figure 21 is a “slide show” displaying five members of the family, all graphed in the 
viewing rectangle 5, 4 by 2, 2. As predicted, c  1 is the value at which a transition 
takes place from two vertical asymptotes to one, and then to none. As c increases 
from 1, we see that the maximum point becomes lower; this is explained by the fact that 
1c  1 l 0 as c l 
. As c decreases from 1, the vertical asymptotes become more 
widely separated because the distance between them is 2s1  c, which becomes large 
as c l 
. Again, the maximum point approaches the x-axis because 1c  1 l 0 
as c l 
. 


c=_1 c=0 c=1 c=2 c=3 
FIGURE 21 The family of functions ƒ=1/(˜+2x+c) 

There is clearly no inflection point when c  1. For c 	 1 we calculate that 
23x2  6x  4  c 

f x  

x2  2x  c3 

and deduce that inflection points occur when x  1  s3c  13. So the inflection 
points become more spread out as c increases and this seems plausible from the last two 
parts of Figure 21.

|||| 4.7 Optimization Problems 

The methods we have learned in this chapter for finding extreme values have practical 
applications in many areas of life. A businessperson wants to minimize costs and maximize 
profits. A traveler wants to minimize transportation time. Fermat’s Principle in optics 
states that light follows the path that takes the least time. In this section and the next we 
solve such problems as maximizing areas, volumes, and profits and minimizing distances, 
times, and costs. 

In solving such practical problems the greatest challenge is often to convert the word 
problem into a mathematical optimization problem by setting up the function that is to be 
maximized or minimized. Let’s recall the problem-solving principles discussed on page 80 
and adapt them to this situation: 

Steps in Solving Optimization Problems 

1. Understand the Problem 
The first step is to read the problem carefully until it is clearly 
understood. Ask yourself: What is the unknown? What are the given quantities? 
What are the given conditions? 
2. Draw a Diagram 
In most problems it is useful to draw a diagram and identify the 
given and required quantities on the diagram. 
3. Introduce Notation 
Assign a symbol to the quantity that is to be maximized or minimized 
(let’s call it Q for now). Also select symbols a, b, c,..., x, y for other 
unknown quantities and label the diagram with these symbols. It may help to use 
initials as suggestive symbols—for example, A for area, h for height, t for time. 
4. 
Express Q in terms of some of the other symbols from Step 3. 

332 .... CHAPTER 4 APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION 

5. 
If Q has been expressed as a function of more than one variable in Step 4, use the 
given information to find relationships (in the form of equations) among these 
variables. Then use these equations to eliminate all but one of the variables in the 
expression for Q. Thus, Qx
will be expressed as a function of one variable , say, 
Q  f x. Write the domain of this function. 

6. 
Use the methods of Sections 4.1 and 4.3 to find the absolute maximum or minimum 
value of f . In particular, if the domain of f is a closed interval, then the 
Closed Interval Method in Section 4.1 can be used. 
EXAMPLE 1 A farmer has 2400 ft of fencing and wants to fence off a rectangular field that 
borders a straight river. He needs no fence along the river. What are the dimensions of 
the field that has the largest area? 
|||| Understand the problem 
|||| Analogy: Try special cases 
|||| Draw diagrams 
SOLUTION In order to get a feeling for what is happening in this problem, let’s experiment 
with some special cases. Figure 1 (not to scale) shows three possible ways of laying out 
the 2400 ft of fencing. We see that when we try shallow, wide fields or deep, narrow 
fields, we get relatively small areas. It seems plausible that there is some intermediate 
configuration that produces the largest area.

FIGURE 1 
|||| Introduce notation 
Figure 2 illustrates the general case. We wish to maximize the area of the rectangle. 
Let and be the depth and width of the rectangle (in feet). Then we express in terms 
of and : 
A  xy 
yx 
Ayx 
A 
We want to express as a function of just one variable, so we eliminate by expressing 
it in terms of . To do this we use the given information that the total length of the fencing 
is 2400 ft. Thus 
2x  y  2400 
x 
yA 
From this equation we have , which gives y  2400  2x 
FIGURE 2 
A  x2400  2x  2400x  2x2 
Note that 0 and (otherwise ). So the function that we wish to maximize 
is 
A  0x  1200x  
Ax  2400x  2x2 0  x  1200 
The derivative is , so to find the critical numbers we solve the

which gives x  600. The maximum value of A must occur either at this critical number 
or at an endpoint of the interval. Since A0  0, A600  720,000, and A1200  0, 
the Closed Interval Method gives the maximum value as A600  720,000. 

[Alternatively, we could have observed that Ax  4  0 for all x, so A is always 
concave downward and the local maximum at x  600 must be an absolute maximum.] 
Thus, the rectangular field should be 600 ft deep and 1200 ft wide. 


EXAMPLE 2 A cylindrical can is to be made to hold 1 L of oil. Find the dimensions that 
will minimize the cost of the metal to manufacture the can. 

SOLUTION Draw the diagram as in Figure 3, where r is the radius and h the height (both in 
h centimeters). In order to minimize the cost of the metal, we minimize the total surface 
area of the cylinder (top, bottom, and sides). From Figure 4 we see that the sides are 

made from a rectangular sheet with dimensions 

2r 

and h. So the surface area is 

A  2r

2  2rh 

FIGURE 3 

To eliminate h we use the fact that the volume is given as 1 L, which we take to be

(a) If for all and for all , then is the absolutef cx 	 cf x  0x  cf x 	 0 
maximum value of .f 
(b) If for all and for all , then is the absolutef cx 	 cf x 	 0x  cf x  0 
minimum value of .f 
NOTE 2  An alternative method for solving optimization problems is to use implicit differentiation. 
Let’s look at Example 2 again to illustrate the method. We work with the same 
equations 

A  2r

2  2rh 

r

2h  100 

but instead of eliminating h, we differentiate both equations implicitly with respect to r: 

A  4r  2

h  2

rh 

2rh  

r

2h  0 

The minimum occurs at a critical number, so we set A  0, simplify, and arrive at the 
equations 

2r  h  rh  02h  rh  0 
and subtraction gives 2r  h  0, or h  2r. 

EXAMPLE 3 Find the point on the parabola y2  2x that is closest to the point 1, 4. 
SOLUTION The distance between the point 1, 4 and the point x, y is 
d  sx  12  y  42 
(See Figure 6.) But if x, y lies on the parabola, then x  y22, so the expression for d 
becomes 
d  s(1 2  1)2  y  42 

2 y

(Alternatively, we could have substituted y  s2x to get d in terms of x alone.) Instead 
of minimizing d, we minimize its square: 

x 
y 
0 1

2 3 4 
¥=2x 
(1, 4) 
(x, y) 
FIGURE 6 d2  f y  (1 2  1)2  y  42 

2 y

(You should convince yourself that the minimum of d occurs at the same point as the 
minimum of d2, but d2 is easier to work with.) Differentiating, we obtain 

f y  2(12 y2  1)y  2y  4  y3  8 

so f y  0 when y  2. Observe that f y  0 when y  2 and f y 	 0 when 
y 	 2, so by the First Derivative Test for Absolute Extreme Values, the absolute minimum 
occurs when y  2. (Or we could simply say that because of the geometric nature 
of the problem, it’s obvious that there is a closest point but not a farthest point.) The 
corresponding value of x is x  y22  2. Thus, the point on y2  2x closest to 1, 4 
is 2, 2.

EXAMPLE 4 A man launches his boat from point A on a bank of a straight river, 3 km 
wide, and wants to reach point B, 8 km downstream on the opposite bank, as quickly as 
possible (see Figure 7). He could row his boat directly across the river to point C and 
then run to B, or he could row directly to B, or he could row to some point D between C 
and B and then run to B. If he can row 6 kmh and run 8 kmh, where should he land to 
reach B as soon as possible? (We assume that the speed of the water is negligible compared 
with the speed at which the man rows.) 

SOLUTION If we let x be the distance from C to D, then the running distance 
is  DB   8  x and the Pythagorean Theorem gives the rowing distance as 
 AD   sx2  9. We use the equation 

distance 

time 

Then the rowing time is sx2  96 and the running time is 8  x8, so the total time 
T as a function of x is 

sx2  98  x 

Tx   

68 

The domain of this function T is 0, 8. Notice that if x  0 he rows to C and if x  8 
he rows directly to B. The derivative of T is 

x 1 

Tx   

6sx2  98 

Thus, using the fact that x  0, we have

&? 16x2  9x2  9 &? 7x2  81

&? x  

s7 

The only critical number is x  9s7. To see whether the minimum occurs at this critical 
number or at an endpoint of the domain 0, 8, we evaluate T at all three points: 

s7 s73 

T0  1.5 T
 9   1   1.33 T8   1.42 

s78 6 

Since the smallest of these values of T occurs when x  9s7, the absolute minimum 
value of T must occur there. Figure 8 illustrates this calculation by showing the graph 
of T. 

Thus, the man should land the boat at a point 9s7 km ( 3.4 km) downstream from 
his starting point.

Let x, y be the vertex that lies in the first quadrant. Then the rectangle has sides of

A  2xy 

To eliminate y we use the fact that x, y lies on the circle x2  y2  r2 and so

61. 
Ornithologists have determined that some species of birds 
tend to avoid flights over large bodies of water during daylight 
hours. It is believed that more energy is required to fly over 
water than land because air generally rises over land and falls 
over water during the day. A bird with these tendencies is 
released from an island that is 5 km from the nearest point B 
on a straight shoreline, flies to a point C on the shoreline, and 
then flies along the shoreline to its nesting area D. Assume that 
the bird instinctively chooses a path that will minimize its 
energy expenditure. Points B and D are 13 km apart.

water as land, to what point C should the bird fly in order

corresponding to the minimum expenditure of energy.

Two light sources of identical strength are placed 10 m apart. 
An object is to be placed at a point P on a line  parallel to the

The Shape of a Can 

In this project we investigate the most economical shape for a can. We first interpret this to mean 
that the volume V of a cylindrical can is given and we need to find the height h and radius r that 
minimize the cost of the metal to make the can (see the figure). If we disregard any waste metal 
in the manufacturing process, then the problem is to minimize the surface area of the cylinder. 

h 

We solved this problem in Example 2 in Section 4.7 and we found that h  2r; that is, the height 
should be the same as the diameter. But if you go to your cupboard or your supermarket with a 
ruler, you will discover that the height is usually greater than the diameter and the ratio hr varies 
from 2 up to about 3.8. Let’s see if we can explain this phenomenon. 


342 .... CHAPTER 4 APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION 

1. 
The material for the cans is cut from sheets of metal. The cylindrical sides are formed by 
bending rectangles; these rectangles are cut from the sheet with little or no waste. But if the 
top and bottom discs are cut from squares of side 2r (as in the figure), this leaves considerable 
waste metal, which may be recycled but has little or no value to the can makers. If this 
is the case, show that the amount of metal used is minimized when

A more efficient packing of the discs is obtained by dividing the metal sheet into hexagons

strategy is adopted, then

3. 
The values of hr that we found in Problems 1 and 2 are a little closer to the ones that 
actually occur on supermarket shelves, but they still don’t account for everything. If we 
look more closely at some real cans, we see that the lid and the base are formed from discs 
with radius larger than r that are bent over the ends of the can. If we allow for this we 
would increase hr. More significantly, in addition to the cost of the metal we need to incorporate 
the manufacturing of the can into the cost. Let’s assume that most of the expense is 
incurred in joining the sides to the rims of the cans. If we cut the discs from hexagons as in 
Problem 2, then the total cost is proportional to

Plot sVk as a function of x  hr and use your graph to argue that when a can is large or 
joining is cheap, we should make hr approximately 2.21 (as in Problem 2). But when the 
can is small or joining is costly, hr should be substantially larger. 

5. 
Our analysis shows that large cans should be almost square but small cans should be tall and 
thin. Take a look at the relative shapes of the cans in a supermarket. Is our conclusion usually 
true in practice? Are there exceptions? Can you suggest reasons why small cans are not 
always tall and thin?

In Section 3.3 we introduced the idea of marginal cost. Recall that if Cx, the cost function, 
is the cost of producing x units of a certain product, then the marginal cost is the rate 
of change of C with respect to x. In other words, the marginal cost function is the derivative, 
Cx, of the cost function. 

The graph of a typical cost function is shown in Figure 1. The marginal cost Cx is the 
slope of the tangent to the cost curve at x, Cx. Notice that the cost curve is initially concave 
downward (the marginal cost is decreasing) because of economies of scale (more efficient 
use of the fixed costs of production). But eventually there is an inflection point and 
the cost curve becomes concave upward (the marginal cost is increasing), perhaps because

Therefore: 

|||| See Example 8 in Section 3.3 for an 
explanation of why it is reasonable to model 
a cost function by a polynomial. 

If the average cost is a minimum, then 
marginal cost  average cost 

This principle is plausible because if our marginal cost is smaller than our average cost, 
then we should produce more, thereby lowering our average cost. Similarly, if our marginal 
cost is larger than our average cost, then we should produce less in order to lower our 
average cost.

Now let’s consider marketing. Let px be the price per unit that the company can 
charge if it sells x units. Then p is called the demand function (or price function) and we 
would expect it to be a decreasing function of x. If x units are sold and the price per unit 
is px, then the total revenue is 

Rx  xpx 

and R is called the revenue function (or sales function). The derivative R of the revenue 
function is called the marginal revenue function and is the rate of change of revenue with 
respect to the number of units sold. 

If x units are sold, then the total profit is 

Px  Rx  Cx 

and P is called the profit function. The marginal profit function is P, the derivative of 
the profit function. In order to maximize profit we look for the critical numbers of P, that 
is, the numbers where the marginal profit is 0. But if 

Px  Rx  Cx  0 

then Rx  Cx 

Therefore: 

If the profit is a maximum, then 
marginal revenue  marginal cost

To ensure that this condition gives a maximum, we could use the Second Derivative 
Test. Note that 

P	x  R	x  C	x  0 
when R	x  C	x 
and this condition says that the rate of increase of marginal revenue is less than the rate of 

increase of marginal cost. Thus, the profit will be a maximum when 

Rx  Cx and R	x  C	x 

EXAMPLE 2 Determine the production level that will maximize the profit for a company 
with cost and demand functions 

Cx  84  1.26x  0.01x2  0.00007x3 and px  3.5  0.01x 

SOLUTION The revenue function is 

Rx  xpx  3.5x  0.01x2 
so the marginal revenue function is 
Rx  3.5  0.02x 
and the marginal cost function is 
Cx  1.26  0.02x  0.00021x2 
Thus, marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost when 

3.5  0.02x  1.26  0.02x  0.00021x2 
Solving, we get 
x  	 2.24

To check that this gives a maximum, we compute the second derivatives: 

R	x  0.02 C	x  0.02  0.00042x 

Thus, R	x  C	x for all x

the profit.

survey indicates that for each $10 rebate offered to buyers, the number of players sold 
will increase by 20 a week. Find the demand function and the revenue function. How 
large a rebate should the store offer to maximize its revenue? 

SOLUTION If x is the number of DVD players sold per week, then the weekly increase in 
sales is x  200. For each increase of 20 players sold, the price is decreased by $10. So 
for each additional player sold, the decrease in price will be 201  10 and the demand

Since Rx  450  x, we see that Rx  0 when x  450. This value of x gives an 
absolute maximum by the First Derivative Test (or simply by observing that the graph of 
R is a parabola that opens downward). The corresponding price is 

p450  450  21 450  225 

and the rebate is 350  225  125. Therefore, to maximize revenue the store should

For a quadratic equation ax2  bx  c  0 there is a well-known formula for the roots. 
For third- and fourth-degree equations there are also formulas for the roots, but they are 
extremely complicated. If f is a polynomial of degree 5 or higher, there is no such formula 
(see the note on page 230). Likewise, there is no formula that will enable us to find the 
exact roots of a transcendental equation such as cos x  x. 

We can find an approximate solution to Equation 1 by plotting the left side of the equation. 
Using a graphing device, and after experimenting with viewing rectangles, we produce 
the graph in Figure 1. 

We see that in addition to the solution x  0, which doesn’t interest us, there is a solution 
between 0.007 and 0.008. Zooming in shows that the root is approximately 0.0076. If 
we need more accuracy we could zoom in repeatedly, but that becomes tiresome. A faster 
alternative is to use a numerical rootfinder on a calculator or computer algebra system. If 
we do so, we find that the root, correct to nine decimal places, is 0.007628603. 

How do those numerical rootfinders work? They use a variety of methods, but most of 
them make some use of Newton’s method , also called the Newton-Raphson method. We 
will explain how this method works, partly to show what happens inside a calculator or 
computer, and partly as an application of the idea of linear approximation. 

The geometry behind Newton’s method is shown in Figure 2, where the root that we are 
trying to find is labeled r. We start with a first approximation x1, which is obtained by 
guessing, or from a rough sketch of the graph of f , or from a computer-generated graph 
of f. Consider the tangent line L to the curve y  f x at the point x1, f x1 and look at 
the x-intercept of L, labeled x2. The idea behind Newton’s method is that the tangent line 
is close to the curve and so its x-intercept, x2, is close to the x-intercept of the curve 
(namely, the root r that we are seeking). Because the tangent is a line, we can easily find 
its x-intercept. 

To find a formula for x2 in terms of x1 we use the fact that the slope of L is f x1, so its 
equation is 

y  f x1  f x1x  x1 

Since the x-intercept of L is x2, we set y  0 and obtain 

0  f x1  f x1x2  x1 

If f x1  0, we can solve this equation for x2: 

f x1 

x2  x1  

f x1 

We use x2 as a second approximation to r. 

Next we repeat this procedure with x1 replaced by x2, using the tangent line at 
x2, f x2 . This gives a third approximation: 

f x2  

x3  x2  

f x2  

If we keep repeating this process, we obtain a sequence of approximations x1, x2, x3, x4, ... 
as shown in Figure 3. In general, if the nth approximation is xn and f xn   0, then the 
next approximation is given by

If the numbers xn become closer and closer to r as n becomes large, then we say that 
the sequence converges to r and we write 

lim xn  r 

n l  

| Although the sequence of successive approximations converges to the desired root for 
functions of the type illustrated in Figure 3, in certain circumstances the sequence may not 
converge. For example, consider the situation shown in Figure 4. You can see that x2 is a 
worse approximation than x1. This is likely to be the case when f x1 is close to 0. It might 
even happen that an approximation (such as x3 in Figure 4) falls outside the domain of f . 
Then Newton’s method fails and a better initial approximation x1 should be chosen. See 
Exercises 31–34 for specific examples in which Newton’s method works very slowly or 
does not work at all. 

EXAMPLE 1 Starting with x1  2, find the third approximation x3 to the root of the 

equation x3  2x  5  0. 

SOLUTION We apply Newton’s method with 

f x  x3  2x  5 and f x  3x2  2 

Newton himself used this equation to illustrate his method and he chose x1  2 after 
some experimentation because f 1  6, f 2  1, and f 3  16. Equation 2 
becomes

23  22  5

2.13  22.1  5 

 2.1   2.0946 

32.12  2 

It turns out that this third approximation x3  2.0946 is accurate to four decimal places. 


Suppose that we want to achieve a given accuracy, say to eight decimal places, using 
Newton’s method. How do we know when to stop? The rule of thumb that is generally used 
is that we can stop when successive approximations xn and xn1 agree to eight decimal 
places. (A precise statement concerning accuracy in Newton’s method will be given in 
Exercises 11.12.) 

Notice that the procedure in going from n to n  1 is the same for all values of n. (It is 
called an iterative process.) This means that Newton’s method is particularly convenient 
for use with a programmable calculator or a computer.

and so we obtain the same answer as before, but with one fewer step. 
You might wonder why we bother at all with Newton’s method if a graphing device is 
available. Isn’t it easier to zoom in repeatedly and find the roots as we did in Section 1.4? 
If only one or two decimal places of accuracy are required, then indeed Newton’s method 
is inappropriate and a graphing device suffices. But if six or eight decimal places are 
required, then repeated zooming becomes tiresome. It is usually faster and more efficient 
to use a computer and Newton’s method in tandem—the graphing device to get started and 
Newton’s method to finish.

A physicist who knows the velocity of a particle might wish to know its position at a given 
time. An engineer who can measure the variable rate at which water is leaking from a tank 
wants to know the amount leaked over a certain time period. A biologist who knows the 
rate at which a bacteria population is increasing might want to deduce what the size of the 
population will be at some future time. In each case, the problem is to find a function F 
whose derivative is a known function f. If such a function F exists, it is called an antiderivative 
of f.

For instance, let f x  x2. It isn’t difficult to discover an antiderivative of f if we keep 
the Power Rule in mind. In fact, if Fx  13 x3, then Fx  x2  f x. But the function 
Gx  13 x3  100 also satisfies Gx  x2. Therefore, both F and G are antiderivatives 
of f . Indeed, any function of the form Hx  31 x3  C, where C is a constant, is an antiderivative 
of f . The question arises: Are there any others? 

To answer this question, recall that in Section 4.2 we used the Mean Value Theorem to 

prove that if two functions have identical derivatives on an interval, then they must differ 

by a constant (Corollary 4.2.7). Thus, if F and G are any two antiderivatives of f , then

Fx  f x  Gx

where C is an arbitrary constant. 

Going back to the function f x  x2, we see that the general antiderivative of f is

whose graphs are vertical translates of one another (see Figure 1).

SOLUTION 

(a) If Fx  cos x, then Fx  sin x, so an antiderivative of sin x is cos x. By 
Theorem 1, the most general antiderivative is Gx  cos x  C. 
(b) Recall from Section 3.8 that 
d 1

So on the interval 0,  the general antiderivative of 1x is ln x  C. We also learned 

that 
d 
ln  x  

dx x 

for all x  0. Theorem 1 then tells us that the general antiderivative of f x  1x is 
ln  x   C on any interval that doesn’t contain 0. In particular, this is true on each of the 
intervals , 0 and 0, . So the general antiderivative of f is 

Fx  ln x  C1 if x  0 
lnx  C2 if x

Thus, the general antiderivative of f x  xn is

Fx   C

n

This is valid for n 	 0 since then f x  xis defined on an interval. If n is negative 
(but n  1), it is valid on any interval that doesn’t contain 0. 


As in Example 1, every differentiation formula, when read from right to left, gives rise 
to an antidifferentiation formula. In Table 2 we list some particular antiderivatives. Each 
formula in the table is true because the derivative of the function in the right column 
appears in the left column. In particular, the first formula says that the antiderivative of a 
constant times a function is the constant times the antiderivative of the function. The second 
formula says that the antiderivative of a sum is the sum of the antiderivatives. (We use 
the notation F  f , G  t.)

In applications of calculus it is very common to have a situation as in Example 2, where 
it is required to find a function, given knowledge about its derivatives. An equation that 
involves the derivatives of a function is called a differential equation. These will be 
studied in some detail in Chapter 9, but for the present we can solve some elementary differential 
equations. The general solution of a differential equation involves an arbitrary 
constant (or constants) as in Example 2. However, there may be some extra conditions 
given that will determine the constants and therefore uniquely specify the solution.

we have C  3. Therefore, the required function is

The Geometry of Antiderivatives 

If we are given the graph of a function f , it seems reasonable that we should be able to 
sketch the graph of an antiderivative F. Suppose, for instance, that we are given that 
F0  1. Then we have a place to start, the point 0, 1, and the direction in which we 
move our pencil is given at each stage by the derivative Fx  f x. In the next example 
we use the principles of this chapter to show how to graph F even when we don’t have a 
formula for f . This would be the case, for instance, when f x is determined by experimental 
data. 

y 

EXAMPLE 5 The graph of a function f is given in Figure 3. Make a rough sketch of an 
y=ƒ antiderivative F, given that F0  2. 

SOLUTION We are guided by the fact that the slope of y  Fx is f x. We start at the 

0 

x

 x 
 1. Notice that f 1  f 3  0, so F has horizontal tangents when x  1 and 
x  3. For 1 
 x 
 3, f x is positive and so F is increasing. We see that F has a local 
minimum when x  1 and a local maximum when x  3. For x  3, f x is negative 
and so F is decreasing on 3, . Since f x l 0 as x l , the graph of F becomes 
FIGURE 3 flatter as x l . Also notice that Fx  f x changes from positive to negative at 
x  2 and from negative to positive at x  4, so F has inflection points when x  2 and 
x  4. We use this information to sketch the graph of the antiderivative in Figure 4.

EXAMPLE 6 If f x  s1  x3  x, sketch the graph of the antiderivative F that satisfies 
the initial condition F1  0. 

SOLUTION We could try all day to think of a formula for an antiderivative of f and still be 
unsuccessful. A second possibility would be to draw the graph of f first and then use it 
to graph F as in Example 5. That would work, but instead let’s create a more accurate 
graph by using what is called a direction field. 

FIGURE 4 Since f 0  1, the graph of F has slope 1 when x  0. So we draw several short 
tangent segments with slope 1, all centered at x  0. We do the same for several other 
values of x and the result is shown in Figure 5. It is called a direction field because each 
segment indicates the direction in which the curve y  Fx proceeds at that point.

SECTION 4.10 ANTIDERIVATIVES .... 357 

Now we use the direction field to sketch the graph of F. Because of the initial condition 
F1  0, we start at the point 1, 0 and draw the graph so that it follows the 
directions of the tangent segments. The result is pictured in Figure 6. Any other antiderivative 
would be obtained by shifting the graph of F upward or downward. 

Rectilinear Motion 

Antidifferentiation is particularly useful in analyzing the motion of an object moving in a 
straight line. Recall that if the object has position function s  f t, then the velocity function 
is vt  st. This means that the position function is an antiderivative of the velocity 
function. Likewise, the acceleration function is at  vt, so the velocity function is 
an antiderivative of the acceleration. If the acceleration and the initial values s0 and v0 
are known, then the position function can be found by antidifferentiating twice. 

EXAMPLE 7 A particle moves in a straight line and has acceleration given by 
at  6t  4. Its initial velocity is v0  6 cms and its initial displacement is 
s0  9 cm. Find its position function st. 

SOLUTION Since vt  at  6t  4, antidifferentiation gives 

t2 

vt  6  4t  C  3t2  4t  C 

2 

Note that v0  C. But we are given that v0  6, so C  6 and 

vt  3t2  4t  6 

Since vt  st, s is the antiderivative of v : 

t3 t2 

st  3  4  6t  D  t3  2t2  6t  D 

32 

This gives s0  D. We are given that s0  9, so D  9 and the required position 
function is 

st  t3  2t2  6t  9 

An object near the surface of the earth is subject to a gravitational force that produces 
a downward acceleration denoted by t. For motion close to the ground we may assume that 

22

t is constant, its value being about 9.8 ms (or 32 fts). 

EXAMPLE 8 A ball is thrown upward with a speed of 48 fts from the edge of a cliff 
432 ft above the ground. Find its height above the ground t seconds later. When does it 
reach its maximum height? When does it hit the ground? 

SOLUTION The motion is vertical and we choose the positive direction to be upward. At 
time t the distance above the ground is st and the velocity vt is decreasing. Therefore, 
the acceleration must be negative and we have 

dv 

at  32 

dt 

Taking antiderivatives, we have 

vt  32t  C 


358 .... CHAPTER 4 APPLICATIONS OF DIFFERENTIATION 

To determine C we use the given information that v0  48. This gives 48  0  C, so 
vt  32t  48 
The maximum height is reached when vt  0, that is, after 1.5 s. Since st  vt, we 


antidifferentiate again and obtain 
st  16t2  48t  D 
Using the fact that s0  432, we have 432  0  D and so 
st  16t2  48t  432 

|||| Figure 7 shows the position function of the 
ball in Example 8. The graph corroborates the The expression for st is valid until the ball hits the ground. This happens when st  0, 
conclusions we reached: The ball reaches its that is, when 
maximum height after 1.5 s and hits the ground 
after 6.9 s. 16t2  48t  432  0

We reject the solution with the minus sign since it gives a negative value for t. Therefore,

PROBLEMS 
PLUS 

Look Back 

What have we learned from the solution to this 
example? 

|||| 
To solve a problem involving several 
variables, it might help to solve a similar 
problem with just one variable. 

|||| 
When trying to prove an inequality, it might 
help to think of it as a maximum or minimum 
problem. 

One of the most important principles of problem solving is analogy (see page 80). If you 
are having trouble getting started on a problem, it is sometimes helpful to start by solving 
a similar, but simpler, problem. The following example illustrates the principle. Cover up 
the solution and try solving it yourself first. 

EXAMPLE If x, y, and z are positive numbers, prove that

 8

SOLUTION It may be difficult to get started on this problem. (Some students have tackled 
it by multiplying out the numerator, but that just creates a mess.) Let’s try to think of a 
similar, simpler problem. When several variables are involved, it’s often helpful to think 
of an analogous problem with fewer variables. In the present case we can reduce the 
number of variables from three to one and prove the analogous inequality

and the transmitted signals are recorded at a point Q, which is a distance D from P. The first 
signal to arrive at Q travels along the surface and takes T1 seconds. The next signal travels 
from P to a point R, from R to S in the lower layer, and then to Q, taking T2 seconds. The third

To compute an area we approximate a region by rectangles 
(Chapter) 
and let the number of rectangles become large. The precise 
area is the limit of these sums of areas of rectangles. 

Integrals

A Preview of Calculus (see page 2). It discusses 
the unifying ideas of calculus and helps put in 
perspective where we have been and where we 
are going. 

with the area and distance problems and uses them to formulate 
the idea of a definite integral, which is the basic 
concept of integral calculus. We will see in Chapters 6 and 8 how to use the integral 
to solve problems concerning volumes, lengths of curves, population predictions, 
cardiac output, forces on a dam, work, consumer surplus, and baseball, 
among many others. 

There is a connection between integral calculus and differential calculus. The 
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus relates the integral to the derivative, and we will 
see in this chapter that it greatly simplifies the solution of many problems. 

|||| 5.1 Areas and Distances 

In this section we discover that in trying to find the area under a curve or the distance 
traveled by a car, we end up with the same special type of limit. 

The Area Problem 

In Chapter 2 we used the tangent and velocity problems to 
introduce the derivative, which is the central idea in differential 
calculus. In much the same way, this chapter starts 

We begin by attempting to solve the area problem: Find the area of the region S that lies 
under the curve y  f x from a to b. This means that S, illustrated in Figure 1, is bounded 
by the graph of a continuous function f [where f x  0], the vertical lines x  a and 
x  b, and the x-axis.

In trying to solve the area problem we have to ask ourselves: What is the meaning of 
the word area? This question is easy to answer for regions with straight sides. For a rectangle, 
the area is defined as the product of the length and the width. The area of a triangle 
is half the base times the height. The area of a polygon is found by dividing it into triangles 
(as in Figure 2) and adding the areas of the triangles.

Try placing rectangles to estimate the area.

/ Estimating Area under a Parabola 


FIGURE 3 

However, it isn’t so easy to find the area of a region with curved sides. We all have an 
intuitive idea of what the area of a region is. But part of the area problem is to make this 
intuitive idea precise by giving an exact definition of area. 

Recall that in defining a tangent we first approximated the slope of the tangent line by 
slopes of secant lines and then we took the limit of these approximations. We pursue a similar 
idea for areas. We first approximate the region S by rectangles and then we take the 
limit of the areas of these rectangles as we increase the number of rectangles. The following 
example illustrates the procedure. 

EXAMPLE 1 Use rectangles to estimate the area under the parabola y  x2 from 0 to 1 
(the parabolic region S illustrated in Figure 3).

SOLUTION We first notice that the area of S must be somewhere between 0 and 1 because S 
is contained in a square with side length 1, but we can certainly do better than that. Suppose 
we divide S into four strips S1, S2, S3, and S4 by drawing the vertical lines x  41, 
x  21, and x  43 as in Figure 4(a).

We can approximate each strip by a rectangle whose base is the same as the strip and 

whose height is the same as the right edge of the strip [see Figure 4(b)]. In other words, 

the heights of these rectangles are the values of the function f x  x2 at the right end 

points of the subintervals [0, 1], [41, 1], [21, 3], and [43, 1].

0.21875  A  0.46875

happens when we divide the region S into eight strips of equal width.

(a) Using left endpoints (b) Using right endpoints 
By computing the sum of the areas of the smaller rectangles L8  and the sum of the 
areas of the larger rectangles R8 , we obtain better lower and upper estimates for A: 

0.2734375  A  0.3984375 

So one possible answer to the question is to say that the true area of S lies somewhere 
between 0.2734375 and 0.3984375. 

We could obtain better estimates by increasing the number of strips. The table at the 
left shows the results of similar calculations (with a computer) using n rectangles whose 
heights are found with left endpoints Ln  or right endpoints Rn . In particular, we see 
by using 50 strips that the area lies between 0.3234 and 0.3434. With 1000 strips we 
narrow it down even more: A lies between 0.3328335 and 0.3338335. A good estimate is 
obtained by averaging these numbers: A  0.3333335. 


From the values in the table in Example 1, it looks as if Rn is approaching 31 as n 
increases. We confirm this in the next example.

The Distance Problem 

Now let’s consider the distance problem: Find the distance traveled by an object during a 
certain time period if the velocity of the object is known at all times. (In a sense this is the 
inverse problem of the velocity problem that we discussed in Section 2.1.) If the velocity 
remains constant, then the distance problem is easy to solve by means of the formula 

distance  velocity 	time 

But if the velocity varies, it’s not so easy to find the distance traveled. We investigate the 
problem in the following example. 

EXAMPLE 4 Suppose the odometer on our car is broken and we want to estimate the distance 
driven over a 30-second time interval. We take speedometer readings every five 
seconds and record them in the following table: 

Time (s) 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 
Velocity (mih) 17 21 24 29 32 31 28 

In order to have the time and the velocity in consistent units, let’s convert the velocity 
readings to feet per second (1 mih  52803600 fts): 

Time (s) 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 
Velocity (fts) 25 31 35 43 47 46 41 

During the first five seconds the velocity doesn’t change very much, so we can estimate 
the distance traveled during that time by assuming that the velocity is constant. If we 
take the velocity during that time interval to be the initial velocity (25 fts), then we

SECTION 5.1 AREAS AND DISTANCES .... 377 

obtain the approximate distance traveled during the first five seconds: 

25 fts 	5 s  125 ft 

Similarly, during the second time interval the velocity is approximately constant and we 
take it to be the velocity when t  5 s. So our estimate for the distance traveled from 
t  5 s to t  10 s is 

31 fts 	5 s  155 ft 

If we add similar estimates for the other time intervals, we obtain an estimate for the 
total distance traveled: 

25 	5 31 	5 35 	5 43 	5 47 	5 46 	5  1135 ft 

We could just as well have used the velocity at the end of each time period instead of 
the velocity at the beginning as our assumed constant velocity. Then our estimate 
becomes 

31 	5 35 	5 43 	5 47 	5 46 	5 41 	5  1215 ft 

If we had wanted a more accurate estimate, we could have taken velocity readings every 
two seconds, or even every second. 


Perhaps the calculations in Example 4 remind you of the sums we used earlier to estimate 
areas. The similarity is explained when we sketch a graph of the velocity function of 
the car in Figure 16 and draw rectangles whose heights are the initial velocities for each 
time interval. The area of the first rectangle is 25 	5  125, which is also our estimate 
for the distance traveled in the first five seconds. In fact, the area of each rectangle can be 
interpreted as a distance because the height represents velocity and the width represents 
time. The sum of the areas of the rectangles in Figure 16 is L6  1135, which is our initial 
estimate for the total distance traveled. 

In general, suppose an object moves with velocity v  f t, where a 
 t 
b and 
f t 0 (so the object always moves in the positive direction). We take velocity readings 
at times t0  a, t1, t2, ..., tn  b so that the velocity is approximately constant on each 
subinterval. If these times are equally spaced, then the time between consecutive readings 
is t  b an. During the first time interval the velocity is approximately f t0  and so 
the distance traveled is approximately f t0  t. Similarly, the distance traveled during the 
second time interval is about f t1 t and the total distance traveled during the time interval 

a, b is approximately

distance becomes

The more frequently we measure the velocity, the more accurate our estimates become, so 
it seems plausible that the exact distance d traveled is the limit of such expressions:

We will see in Section 5.4 that this is indeed true.

378 .... CHAPTER 5 INTEGRALS 

Because Equation 5 has the same form as our expressions for area in Equations 2 and 

3, it follows that the distance traveled is equal to the area under the graph of the velocity 

function. In Chapters 6 and 8 we will see that other quantities of interest in the natural and 

social sciences—such as the work done by a variable force or the cardiac output of the 

heart—can also be interpreted as the area under a curve. So when we compute areas in this 

chapter, bear in mind that they can be interpreted in a variety of practical ways.

of situations even when f is not necessarily a positive function. In Chapters 6 and 8 we 
will see that limits of the form (1) also arise in finding lengths of curves, volumes of solids, 
centers of mass, force due to water pressure, and work, as well as other quantities. We 
therefore give this type of limit a special name and notation.

|||| Bernhard Riemann received his Ph.D. under 
the direction of the legendary Gauss at the 
University of Göttingen and remained there to 
teach. Gauss, who was not in the habit of praising 
other mathematicians, spoke of Riemann’s 
“creative, active, truly mathematical mind and 
gloriously fertile originality.” The definition (2) of 
an integral that we use is due to Riemann. He 
also made major contributions to the theory of 
functions of a complex variable, mathematical 
physics, number theory, and the foundations of 
geometry. Riemann’s broad concept of space and 
geometry turned out to be the right setting, 50 
years later, for Einstein’s general relativity theory. 
Riemann’s health was poor throughout his life, 
and he died of tuberculosis at the age of 39.

Alternatively, we could choose x* i to be the midpoint of the subinterval or any other number

Although most of the functions that we encounter are continuous, the limit in Definition 
2 also exists if f has a finite number of removable or jump discontinuities (but not 
infinite discontinuities). (See Section 2.5.) So we can also define the definite integral for 
such functions.

NOTE 4 In the spirit of the precise definition of the limit of a function in Section 2.4, 
we can write the precise meaning of the limit that defines the integral in Definition 2 as 
follows: 

For every number 0 there is an integer N such that

ai1 

for every integer n N and for every choice of x* i in 
xi1, xi. 

This means that a definite integral can be approximated to within any desired degree of 
accuracy by a Riemann sum. 



NOTE 5 Although we have defined xab f x dx by dividing 
a, b into subintervals of 
equal width, there are situations in which it is advantageous to work with subintervals 
of unequal width. For instance, in Exercise 14 in Section 5.1 NASA provided velocity data 
at times that were not equally spaced, but we were still able to estimate the distance traveled. 
And there are methods for numerical integration that take advantage of unequal 
subintervals. 

If the subinterval widths are x1, x2, ..., xn, we have to ensure that all these widths 
approach 0 in the limiting process. This happens if the largest width, max xi, approaches 

0. So in this case the definition of a definite integral becomes

SECTION 5.2 THE DEFINITE INTEGRAL .... 383 

Later, when we apply the definite integral to physical situations, it will be important to 
recognize limits of sums as integrals, as we did in Example 1. When Leibniz chose the 
notation for an integral, he chose the ingredients as reminders of the limiting process. In 
general, when we write 

n 

lim  f x*i  x  y bf x dx

we replace lim  by x, x* i by x, and x by dx. 

Evaluating Integrals 

When we use the definition to evaluate a definite integral, we need to know how to work 
with sums. The following three equations give formulas for sums of powers of positive 
integers. Equation 4 may be familiar to you from a course in algebra. Equations 5 and 6 
were discussed in Section 5.1 and are proved in Appendix E.

Notice that f is not a positive function and so the Riemann sum does not represent a sum 
of areas of rectangles. But it does represent the sum of the areas of the gold rectangles 
(above the x-axis) minus the sum of the areas of the blue rectangles (below the x-axis) in

This integral can’t be interpreted as an area because f takes on both positive and negative

are shown in Figure 6. 

Figure 7 illustrates the calculation by showing the positive and negative terms in the

The Midpoint Rule 

We often choose the sample point x* i to be the right endpoint of the th subinterval because 

i 
it is convenient for computing the limit. But if the purpose is to find an approximation to 
an integral, it is usually better to choose x* i to be the midpoint of the interval, which we 
denote by xi. Any Riemann sum is an approximation to an integral, but if we use midpoints 
we get the following approximation.

SOLUTION The endpoints of the five subintervals are 1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, and 2.0, 
so the midpoints are 1.1, 1.3, 1.5, 1.7, and 1.9. The width of the subintervals is

Since fx  1x  0 for 1  x  2, the integral represents an area, and the approximation 
given by the Midpoint Rule is the sum of the areas of the rectangles shown in 
Figure 11. 

At the moment we don’t know how accurate the approximation in Example 5 is, but in 
Section 7.7 we will learn a method for estimating the error involved in using the Midpoint 
Rule. At that time we will discuss other methods for approximating definite integrals. 

If we apply the Midpoint Rule to the integral in Example 2, we get the picture in Figure 
12. The approximation M40  6.7563 is much closer to the true value 6.75 than the 
right endpoint approximation, R40  6.3998, shown in Figure 7.

Properties of the Definite Integral 

When we defined the definite integral xab fx dx, we implicitly assumed that a 
 b. But the 
definition as a limit of Riemann sums makes sense even if a  b. Notice that if we reverse 
a and b, then x changes from b  an to a  bn. Therefore

If a  b, then x  0 and so

We now develop some basic properties of integrals that will help us to evaluate integrals 
in a simple manner. We assume that f and t are continuous functions.

Property 1 says that the integral of a constant function f x  c is the constant times

Property 2 says that the integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals. For positive func


y 

tions it says that the area under f  t is the area under f plus the area under t. Figure 14 
helps us understand why this is true: In view of how graphical addition works, the corresponding 
vertical line segments have equal height. 

f+g 

In general, Property 2 follows from Equation 3 and the fact that the limit of a sum is the 
sum of the limits:

|||| Property 3 seems intuitively reasonable 
because we know that multiplying a function by 
a positive number c stretches or shrinks its graph 
vertically by a factor of c. So it stretches or 
shrinks each approximating rectangle by a factor 
c and therefore it has the effect of multiplying 
the area by c.

Property 3 can be proved in a similar manner and says that the integral of a constant 
times a function is the constant times the integral of the function. In other words, a constant 
(but only a constant) can be taken in front of an integral sign. Property 4 is proved by 
writing f  t  f  t and using Properties 2 and 3 with c  1.

If fx  0, then xab fx dx represents the area under the graph of f, so the geometric 
interpretation of Property 6 is simply that areas are positive. But the property can be 

m 

proved from the definition of an integral (Exercise 64). Property 7 says that a bigger funcy=
ƒa bx tion has a bigger integral. It follows from Properties 6 and 4 because f  t  0. 
Property 8 is illustrated by Figure 16 for the case where fx  0. If f is continuous we

area of the rectangle with height m and less than the area of the rectangle with height M.

|||| 5.3 The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus 

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is appropriately named because it establishes a 
connection between the two branches of calculus: differential calculus and integral calculus. 
Differential calculus arose from the tangent problem, whereas integral calculus arose 
from a seemingly unrelated problem, the area problem. Newton’s teacher at Cambridge, 
Isaac Barrow (1630–1677), discovered that these two problems are actually closely 
related. In fact, he realized that differentiation and integration are inverse processes. The 
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus gives the precise inverse relationship between the 
derivative and the integral. It was Newton and Leibniz who exploited this relationship and 
used it to develop calculus into a systematic mathematical method. In particular, they saw

that the Fundamental Theorem enabled them to compute areas and integrals very easily 

Resources / Module 6 
/ Areas and Derivatives without having to compute them as limits of sums as we did in Sections 5.1 and 5.2. 
/ Area as a Function The first part of the Fundamental Theorem deals with functions defined by an equation 
of the form 

tx  y xf t dt

f is a continuous function on a, b and x varies between a and b. Observe that t

x

number, then the integral af t dt is a definite number. If we then let x vary, the number 
also varies and defines a function of x denoted by tx. 
f happens to be a positive function, then tx can be interpreted as the area under the 
f from a to x, where x can vary from a to b. (Think of t as the “area so far” func-
FIGURE 1 tion; see Figure 1.) 

EXAMPLE 1 If f is the function whose graph is shown in Figure 2 and tx  x0

find the values of t0, t1, t2, t3, t4, and t5. Then sketch a rough graph of t.

We use these values to sketch the graph of t in Figure 4. Notice that, because ftis 
positive for t  3, we keep adding area for t  3 and so t is increasing up to x  3, 
where it attains a maximum value. For x  3, t decreases because ftis negative. 


If we take ft t and a  0, then, using Exercise 27 in Section 5.2, we have

tx y tdt 

Notice that tx x, that is, t  f. In other words, if t is defined as the integral of f by 
Equation 1, then t turns out to be an antiderivative of f, at least in this case. And if we 
sketch the derivative of the function t shown in Figure 4 by estimating slopes of tangents, 
we get a graph like that of f in Figure 2. So we suspect that t f in Example 1 too. 

To see why this might be generally true we consider any continuous function f with 
fx 0. Then tx xax ftdt can be interpreted as the area under the graph of f from 
a to x, as in Figure 1. 

In order to compute tx from the definition of derivative we first observe that, 
for h  0, tx  h txis obtained by subtracting areas, so it is the area under the 
graph of f from x to x  h (the gold area in Figure 5). For small h you can see from the 
figure that this area is approximately equal to the area of the rectangle with height fxand 
width :

Intuitively, we therefore expect that

The fact that this is true, even when f is not necessarily positive, is the first part of the 
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. 

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 1 If f is continuous on a, b, then the function 
t defined by 

tx  y xf t dt a 	 x 	 b 

a 

is continuous on a, b and differentiable on a, b, and tx  f x. 

Proof If x and x  h are in a, b, then

tx  h  tx 1 xh 

 y f t dt 

h hx 

For now let us assume that h  0. Since f is continuous on x, x  h, the Extreme 
Value Theorem says that there are numbers u and v in x, x  h such that f u  m and 
f v  M, where m and M are the absolute minimum and maximum values of f on 
x, x  h. (See Figure 6.) 

By Property 8 of integrals, we have 

mh 	 y xhf t dt 	 Mh 

x 

that is, f uh 	 y xhf t dt 	 f vh

Since h  0, we can divide this inequality by h: 

1 xh 

f u 	 y f t dt 	 f v

Now we use Equation 2 to replace the middle part of this inequality:

Inequality 3 can be proved in a similar manner for the case h  0. (See Exercise 63.)

Therefore

h l 0 u lx 

and 
lim f v  lim f v  f x 

h l 0 v lx 

because f is continuous at x. We conclude, from (3) and the Squeeze Theorem, that

If x  a or b, then Equation 4 can be interpreted as a one-sided limit. Then Theorem 
2.9.4 (modified for one-sided limits) shows that t is continuous on a, b. 

Using Leibniz notation for derivatives, we can write FTC1 as

SOLUTION Since f t  s1  t2 is continuous, Part 1 of the Fundamental Theorem of 
Calculus gives 

tx  s1  x2 


EXAMPLE 3 Although a formula of the form tx  xax f t dt may seem like a strange way 
of defining a function, books on physics, chemistry, and statistics are full of such functions. 
For instance, the Fresnel function 

x 

Sx  y

0

 sint2
2 dt 

is named after the French physicist Augustin Fresnel (1788–1827), who is famous for his 
works in optics. This function first appeared in Fresnel’s theory of the diffraction of light 
waves, but more recently it has been applied to the design of highways. 

Part 1 of the Fundamental Theorem tells us how to differentiate the Fresnel function: 

Sx  sinx

2
2 

This means that we can apply all the methods of differential calculus to analyze S (see 
Exercise 57).

|||| We abbreviate this theorem as FTC2. 

Figure 7 shows the graphs of f x  sinx2	2 and the Fresnel function 
Sx  x0 
xf t dt. A computer was used to graph S by computing the value of this integral 
for many values of x. It does indeed look as if Sx is the area under the graph of f from 
0 to x [until x  1.4 when Sx becomes a difference of areas]. Figure 8 shows a larger 
part of the graph of S.

If we now start with the graph of S in Figure 7 and think about what its derivative 
should look like, it seems reasonable that Sx  f x. [For instance, S is increasing 
when f x  0 and decreasing when f x  0.] So this gives a visual confirmation of 
Part 1 of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

In Section 5.2 we computed integrals from the definition as a limit of Riemann sums 
and we saw that this procedure is sometimes long and difficult. The second part of the 
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which follows easily from the first part, provides us 
with a much simpler method for the evaluation of integrals. 

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2 If f is continuous on a, b, then 

y bf x dx  Fb  Fa 

a 

where F is any antiderivative of f , that is, a function such that F  f . 


|||| Compare the calculation in Example 5 with 
the much harder one in Example 3 in Section 5.2. 

SECTION 5.3 THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF CALCULUS .... 399 

Proof Let tx  xax f t dt. We know from Part 1 that tx  f x; that is, t is an antiderivative 
of f . If F is any other antiderivative of f on a, b, then we know from 
Corollary 4.2.7 that F and t differ by a constant: 

6 
Fx  tx  C 

for a  x  b. But both F and t are continuous on a, b and so, by taking limits of both 
sides of Equation 6 (as x l a and x l b ), we see that it also holds when x  a and 
x  b. 

If we put x  a in the formula for tx, we get 

ta  y af t dt  0 

a 

So, using Equation 6 with x  b and x  a, we have 

Fb  Fa  tb  C  ta  C 

 tb  ta  tb  y bf t dt 

a 


Part 2 of the Fundamental Theorem states that if we know an antiderivative F of f , then 
we can evaluate xab f x dx simply by subtracting the values of F at the endpoints of the 
interval a, b. It’s very surprising that xab f x dx, which was defined by a complicated procedure 
involving all of the values of f x for a  x  b, can be found by knowing the values 
of Fx at only two points, a and b. 

Although the theorem may be surprising at first glance, it becomes plausible if we interpret 
it in physical terms. If vt is the velocity of an object and st is its position at time t, 
then vt  st, so s is an antiderivative of v. In Section 5.1 we considered an object that 
always moves in the positive direction and made the guess that the area under the velocity 
curve is equal to the distance traveled. In symbols: 

y b 
vt dt  sb  sa 

a 

That is exactly what FTC2 says in this context.

EXAMPLE 5 Evaluate the integral y ex dx.

SOLUTION The function f x  eis continuous everywhere and we know that an anti

derivative is Fx  e, so Part 2 of the Fundamental Theorem gives 

y 3 
ex dx  F3  F1  e3  e

Notice that FTC2 says we can use any antiderivative F of f. So we may as well use 

x xx

the simplest one, namely Fx  e, instead of e 7 or e C. 


We often use the notation 

Fx]b 
 Fb  Fa

a

So the equation of FTC2 can be written as

where F f

Other common notations are Fx

EXAMPLE 6 Find the area under the parabola y  x2 from 0 to 1. 
SOLUTION An antiderivative of f x  x2 is Fx  13 x3. The required area A is found 
using Part 2 of the Fundamental Theorem:

you will see that the Fundamental Theorem gives a much shorter method.

When the French mathematician Gilles de Roberval first found the area under the sine 
and cosine curves in 1635, this was a very challenging problem that required a great deal 
of ingenuity. If we didn’t have the benefit of the Fundamental Theorem, we would have to 
compute a difficult limit of sums using obscure trigonometric identities (or a computer 
algebra system as in Exercise 25 in Section 5.1). It was even more difficult for Roberval 
because the apparatus of limits had not been invented in 1635. But in the 1660s and 1670s, 
when the Fundamental Theorem was discovered by Barrow and exploited by Newton and 
Leibniz, such problems became very easy, as you can see from Example 8.

SOLUTION To start, we notice that this calculation must be wrong because the answer is 
negative but f x  1	x2 	 0 and Property 6 of integrals says that xab f x dx 	 0 when 
f 	 0. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus applies to continuous functions. It can’t 
be applied here because f x  1	x2 is not continuous on 1, 3. In fact, f has an infinite 
discontinuity at x  0, so

Differentiation and Integration as Inverse Processes 

We end this section by bringing together the two parts of the Fundamental Theorem. 

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Suppose f is continuous on a, b. 

1. If tx  y xf t dt, then tx  f x. 
a 

2. y bf x dx  Fb  Fa, where F is any antiderivative of f , that is, F  f . 
a 

We noted that Part 1 can be rewritten as 

dx 

y f t dt  f x 

dx a 

which says that if f is integrated and then the result is differentiated, we arrive back at the 
original function f . Since Fx  f x, Part 2 can be rewritten as 

y bFx dx  Fb  Fa 

a 

This version says that if we take a function F, first differentiate it, and then integrate the 
result, we arrive back at the original function F, but in the form Fb  Fa. Taken 
together, the two parts of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus say that differentiation 
and integration are inverse processes. Each undoes what the other does. 

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is unquestionably the most important theorem 
in calculus and, indeed, it ranks as one of the great accomplishments of the human mind. 
Before it was discovered, from the time of Eudoxus and Archimedes to the time of Galileo 
and Fermat, problems of finding areas, volumes, and lengths of curves were so difficult 
that only a genius could meet the challenge. But now, armed with the systematic method 
that Newton and Leibniz fashioned out of the Fundamental Theorem, we will see in the 
chapters to come that these challenging problems are accessible to all of us.

SECTION 5.4 INDEFINITE INTEGRALS AND THE NET CHANGE THEOREM .... 405 

|||| 5.4 Indefinite Integrals and the Net Change Theorem 


We saw in Section 5.3 that the second part of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus provides 
a very powerful method for evaluating the definite integral of a function, assuming 
that we can find an antiderivative of the function. In this section we introduce a notation 
for antiderivatives, review the formulas for antiderivatives, and use them to evaluate definite 
integrals. We also reformulate FTC2 in a way that makes it easier to apply to science 
and engineering problems. 

Indefinite Integrals 

Both parts of the Fundamental Theorem establish connections between antiderivatives and 

x
x
x

definite integrals. Part 1 says that if f is continuous, then f t dt is an antiderivative of f. 
Part 2 says that xab f x dx can be found by evaluating F
ab  Fa, where F is an antiderivative 
of f. 

We need a convenient notation for antiderivatives that makes them easy to work with. 
Because of the relation given by the Fundamental Theorem between antiderivatives and 
integrals, the notation x f x dx is traditionally used for an antiderivative of f and is called 
an indefinite integral. Thus 

y f x dx  Fx means Fx  f x 

For example, we can write 

x3 d 3 

2

y x2 dx   C because x
 C x

3 dx 3 

So we can regard an indefinite integral as representing an entire family of functions (one 
antiderivative for each value of the constant C).

| You should distinguish carefully between definite and indefinite integrals. A definite 
integral xab f x dx is a number, whereas an indefinite integral x f x dx is a function (or 
family of functions). The connection between them is given by Part 2 of the Fundamental 
Theorem. If f is continuous on a, b, then 

y bf x dx  y f x dx]b 

a 

a 

The effectiveness of the Fundamental Theorem depends on having a supply of antiderivatives 
of functions. We therefore restate the Table of Antidifferentiation Formulas 
from Section 4.10, together with a few others, in the notation of indefinite integrals. Any 
formula can be verified by differentiating the function on the right side and obtaining the 
integrand. For instance 

y sec2xdx  tan x  C because 
d 
tan x  C  sec2x 

dx

Recall from Theorem 4.10.1 that the most general antiderivative on a given interval is 
obtained by adding a constant to a particular antiderivative. We adopt the convention that 
when a formula for a general indefinite integral is given, it is valid only on an interval. 
Thus, we write 

11 

y 2 dx   C 

xx 

with the understanding that it is valid on the interval 0,  or on the interval , 0. This

408 .... CHAPTER 5 INTEGRALS 

Applications 

Part 2 of the Fundamental Theorem says that if f is continuous on a, b, then 

y bf x dx  Fb  Fa 

a 

where F is any antiderivative of f. This means that F  f , so the equation can be rewritten 
as 

y bFx dx  Fb  Fa 

a 

We know that Fx represents the rate of change of y  Fx with respect to x and 
Fb  Fa is the change in y when x changes from a to b. [Note that y could, for instance, 
increase, then decrease, then increase again. Although y might change in both directions, 
Fb  Fa represents the net change in y.] So we can reformulate FTC2 in words as 
follows. 

The Net Change Theorem The integral of a rate of change is the net change: 

y bFx dx  Fb  Fa 

a 

This principle can be applied to all of the rates of change in the natural and social sciences 
that we discussed in Section 3.3. Here are a few instances of this idea: 

 

If Vt is the volume of water in a reservoir at time t, then its derivative Vt is 
the rate at which water flows into the reservoir at time t. So 

y t2 Vt dt  Vt2   Vt1 

t1 

is the change in the amount of water in the reservoir between time t1 and time t2. 

 

If Ct is the concentration of the product of a chemical reaction at time t, then 
the rate of reaction is the derivative dCdt. So 

t2 dC 

y dt  Ct2   Ct1 

t1 dt 

is the change in the concentration of C from time t1 to time t2. 

 

If the mass of a rod measured from the left end to a point x is mx, then the 

linear density is 

x  mx

. So 

b 

y

a 

x dx  mb  ma 

is the mass of the segment of the rod that lies between x  a and x  b. 

 

If the rate of growth of a population is dndt, then 

t2 dn 

y dt  nt2   nt1 

t1 dt 

is the net change in population during the time period from t1 to t2. (The population 
increases when births happen and decreases when deaths occur. The net 
change takes into account both births and deaths.)

If Cx is the cost of producing x units of a commodity, then the marginal cost is 
the derivative Cx. So 

2

y xCx dx  Cx2   Cx1 

x

1 

is the increase in cost when production is increased from x1 units to x2 units. 

 

If an object moves along a straight line with position function st, then its 
velocity is vt  st, so 


2 
y t2 vt dt  st2   st1 

t1 

is the net change of position, or displacement, of the particle during the time 
period from t1 to t2. In Section 5.1 we guessed that this was true for the case 
where the object moves in the positive direction, but now we have proved that it 
is always true. 

 

If we want to calculate the distance traveled during the time interval, we have to 
consider the intervals when vt  0 (the particle moves to the right) and also the 
intervals when vt  0 (the particle moves to the left). In both cases the distance 
is computed by integrating 	 vt	, the speed. Therefore 

3 
y t 2 	 vt	 dt  total distance traveled

in terms of areas under a velocity curve.

y t 2 at dt  vt2   vt1 

t1

(a) Find the displacement of the particle during the time period 1  t  4.

The energy used was approximately 15,840 megawatt-hours. 

How did we know what units to use for energy in Example 7? The integral x024 Pt dt is 
defined as the limit of sums of terms of the form Pt*i  t. Now Pt*i  is measured in 
megawatts and t is measured in hours, so their product is measured in megawatt-hours. 
The same is true of the limit. In general, the unit of measurement for xab f x dx is the product 
of the unit for f x and the unit for x.

Economists use a cumulative distribution called a Lorenz curve 
to describe the distribution of income between households in a 
given country. Typically, a Lorenz curve is defined on 0, 1 
with endpoints 0, 0 and 1, 1, and is continuous, increasing, 
and concave upward. The points on this curve are determined 
by ranking all households by income and then computing the 
percentage of households whose income is less than or equal 
to a given percentage of the total income of the country. For 
example, the point a100, b100 is on the Lorenz curve if the 
bottom a% of the households receive less than or equal to b% 
of the total income. Absolute equality of income distribution 

would occur if the bottom a% of the households receive a% of 
the income, in which case the Lorenz curve would be the line 
y  x. The area between the Lorenz curve and the line y  x 
measures how much the income distribution differs from 
absolute equality. The coefficient of inequality is the ratio of 
the area between the Lorenz curve and the line y  x to the 
area under y  x.

Newton, Leibniz, and the Invention of Calculus 

We sometimes read that the inventors of calculus were Sir Isaac Newton (1642–1727) and 
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716). But we know that the basic ideas behind integration 
were investigated 2500 years ago by ancient Greeks such as Eudoxus and Archimedes, and methods 
for finding tangents were pioneered by Pierre Fermat (1601–1665), Isaac Barrow (1630–1677), 
and others. Barrow, Newton’s teacher at Cambridge, was the first to understand the inverse relationship 
between differentiation and integration. What Newton and Leibniz did was to use this 
relationship, in the form of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, in order to develop calculus 
into a systematic mathematical discipline. It is in this sense that Newton and Leibniz are credited 
with the invention of calculus. 

Read about the contributions of these men in one or more of the given references and write a 
report on one of the following three topics. You can include biographical details, but the main 
thrust of your report should be a description, in some detail, of their methods and notations. In 
particular, you should consult one of the sourcebooks, which give excerpts from the original 
publications of Newton and Leibniz, translated from Latin to English.

|||| 5.5 The Substitution Rule 


|||| Differentials were defined in Section 3.11. 
If u  f x, then 

du  f x dx 

Because of the Fundamental Theorem, it’s important to be able to find antiderivatives. But 
our antidifferentiation formulas don’t tell us how to evaluate integrals such as 

1
y 2xs1  x2 dx 

To find this integral we use the problem-solving strategy of introducing something extra. 
Here the “something extra” is a new variable; we change from the variable x to a new variable 
u. Suppose that we let u be the quantity under the root sign in (1), u  1  x2. Then 
the differential of u is du  2xdx . Notice that if the dx in the notation for an integral were 
to be interpreted as a differential, then the differential 2xdx would occur in (1) and, so, 
formally, without justifying our calculation, we could write 

2 
y 2xs1  x2 dx  ys1  x2 2xdx  ysu du 

 232  C  22  132  C

3 u3 x

But now we can check that we have the correct answer by using the Chain Rule to differentiate 
the final function of Equation 2: 

d [2 2  132  C]  23 

3 x 
3  2 x2  112  2x  2xsx2  1 

dx 

In general, this method works whenever we have an integral that we can write in the 
form x f txtx dx. Observe that if F  f , then

y Ftxtx dx  Ftx  C

because, by the Chain Rule, 

d 

Ftx  Ftxtx 

dx 

If we make the “change of variable” or “substitution” u  tx, then from Equation 3 
we have 

y Ftxtx dx  Ftx  C  Fu  C  y Fu du 

or, writing F  f, we get 
y ftxtx dx  y fu du 

Thus, we have proved the following rule. 

interval

The Substitution Rule If u  tx is a differentiable function whose range is an 
I and f is continuous on I, then 

y ftxtx dx  y fu du 

Notice that the Substitution Rule for integration was proved using the Chain Rule for 

differentiation. Notice also that if u  tx, then du  tx dx, so a way to remember the 

Substitution Rule is to think of dx and du in (4) as differentials. 

Thus, the Substitution Rule says: It is permissible to operate with dx and du after 
integral signs as if they were differentials. 

EXAMPLE 1 Find y x3 cosx4  2 dx. 

SOLUTION We make the substitution u  x4  2 because its differential is du  4x3 dx, 
which, apart from the constant factor 4, occurs in the integral. Thus, using x3 dx  du4 
and the Substitution Rule, we have 

y x3 cosx4  2 dx  y cos u  4 
1 du  14 y cos udu 

 1 

4 sin u  C 

 1 

4 sinx4  2  C 

|||| Check the answer by differentiating it. Notice that at the final stage we had to return to the original variable x. 


The idea behind the Substitution Rule is to replace a relatively complicated integral 
by a simpler integral. This is accomplished by changing from the original variable x to 
a new variable u that is a function of x. Thus, in Example 1 we replaced the integral 
x x3 cosx4  2 dx by the simpler integral 14 x cos udu . 

The main challenge in using the Substitution Rule is to think of an appropriate substi


tution. You should try to choose u to be some function in the integrand whose differential 

also occurs (except for a constant factor). This was the case in Example 1. If that is not

possible, try choosing u to be some complicated part of the integrand. Finding the right 
substitution is a bit of an art. It’s not unusual to guess wrong; if your first guess doesn’t 
work, try another substitution. 

EXAMPLE 2 Evaluate ys2x  1 dx.

The answer to Example 3 could be checked by differentiation, but instead let’s check 
it with a graph. In Figure 1 we have used a computer to graph both the integrand 
fx  xs1  4x2 and its indefinite integral tx  14 s1  4x2 (we take the case 
C  0). Notice that tx decreases when fx is negative, increases when fx is positive, 
and has its minimum value when fx  0. So it seems reasonable, from the graphical evidence, 
that t is an antiderivative of f. 

EXAMPLE 4 Calculate y e5x dx. 

SOLUTION If we let u  5x, then du  5 dx, so dx  51 du. Therefore

u  1  x2. Then du  2xdx , so xdx  du2. Also x2  u  1, so x4  u  12:

EXAMPLE 6 Calculate y tan xdx . 

SOLUTION First we write tangent in terms of sine and cosine: 
sin x 

y tan xdx  y dx 

cos x 
This suggests that we should substitute u  cos x, since then du  sin x dx and so 
sin x dx  du: 
sin x du 

y tan xdx  y dx  y

cos xu

Since ln 	 cos x	  ln	 cos x	1  ln1	cos x	  ln 	 sec x	, the result of Example 
6 can also be written as 

5 
y tan xdx  ln 	 sec x	  C 

Definite Integrals 

When evaluating a definite integral by substitution, two methods are possible. One method 
is to evaluate the indefinite integral first and then use the Fundamental Theorem. For 
instance, using the result of Example 2, we have 

4 44

Another method, which is usually preferable, is to change the limits of integration when 
the variable is changed. 


418 .... CHAPTER 5 INTEGRALS 

|||| This rule says that when using a substitution 
in a definite integral, we must put everything in 
terms of the new variable u, not only x and dx 
but also the limits of integration. The new limits 
of integration are the values of u that correspond 
to x  a and x  b. 

|||| The geometric interpretation of Example 7 is 
shown in Figure 2. The substitution u  2x  1 
stretches the interval 0, 4 by a factor of 2 and 
translates it to the right by 1 unit. The Substitution 
Rule shows that the two areas are equal.

Theorem 7 is illustrated by Figure 4. For the case where f is positive and even, part (a)

symmetry. Recall that an integral xab fx dx can be expressed as the area above the x-axis

|||| 5.6 The Logarithm Defined as an Integral 

Our treatment of exponential and logarithmic functions until now has relied on our intuition, 
which is based on numerical and visual evidence. (See Sections 1.5, 1.6, and 3.1.) Here we 
use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to give an alternative treatment that provides a 
surer footing for these functions. 

Instead of starting with ax and defining logax as its inverse, this time we start by defining 
ln x as an integral and then define the exponential function as its inverse. In this section 
you should bear in mind that we do not use any of our previous definitions and results 
concerning exponential and logarithmic functions. 

The Natural Logarithm 

We first define

ln x as an integral.

tion always exists. If x  1, then ln x can be interpreted geometrically as the area under 
the hyperbola y  1t from t  1 to t  x. (See Figure 1.) For x  1, we have

SOLUTION 

y= 1t 
(a) We can interpret ln 2 as the area under the curve y  1t from 1 to 2. From Figure 3 
we see that this area is larger than the area of rectangle BCDE and smaller than the area 
of trapezoid ABCD. Thus, we have

Notice that the integral that defines ln x is exactly the type of integral discussed in Part 1 

of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (see Section 5.3). In fact, using that theorem, 

we have

We now use this differentiation rule to prove the following properties of the logarithm 
function.

Laws of Logarithms If x and y are positive numbers and r is a rational number, 
then 
1. lnxy  ln x ln y 2. lnx 	 ln x ln y 3. lnxr   r ln x

Proof 

1. Let f x  lnax, where a is a positive constant. Then, using Equation 2 and the 
Chain Rule, we have

Therefore, f x and ln x have the same derivative and so they must differ by a constant: 

lnax  ln x C 


424 .... CHAPTER 5 INTEGRALS 

Putting x  1 in this equation, we get ln a  ln 1  C  0  C  C. Thus 
lnax  ln x  ln a 
If we now replace the constant a by any number y, we have

Using Law 1 again, we have

lnx 	 lnx  	 ln x  ln  ln x  ln y

The proof of Law 3 is left as an exercise. 
In order to graph y  ln x, we first determine its limits: 

4 
(a) lim ln x   (b) lim ln x   
x l . 
x l 0


Proof 

(a) Using Law 3 with x  2 and r  n (where n is any positive integer), we have 
ln2n   n ln 2. Now ln 2  0, so this shows that ln2n  l  as n l . But ln x is an 
increasing function since its derivative 1x  0. Therefore, ln x l  as x l . 
(b) If we let t  1x, then t l  as x l 0. Thus, using (a), we have

y Since ln 1  0 and ln x is an increasing continuous function that takes on arbitrarily 
large values, the Intermediate Value Theorem shows that there is a number where ln x takes 
on the value 1 (see Figure 5). This important number is denoted by e.

The Natural Exponential Function 

Since ln is an increasing function, it is one-to-one and therefore has an inverse function, 
which we denote by exp. Thus, according to the definition of an inverse function, 

6 
expx  y &? ln y  x 

and the cancellation equations are 

7 
expln x  x and lnexp x  x 

In particular, we have 

exp0  1 since ln 1  0 

exp1  e since ln e  1

We obtain the graph of y  exp xby reflecting the graph of y  ln x about the line y  x. 
(See Figure 6.) The domain of exp is the range of ln, that is, , ; the range of exp is 
the domain of ln, that is, 0, . 

If r is any rational number, then the third law of logarithms gives 

lner   r ln e  r 

r

Therefore, by (6), expr  e

xx

Thus, expx  ewhenever x is a rational number. This leads us to define e, even for irrational 
values of x, by the equation 

x

e expx 

In other words, for the reasons given, we define ex to be the inverse of the function ln x. In

The natural exponential function f x  eis one of the most frequently occurring 
functions in calculus and its applications, so it is important to be familiar with its graph 
(Figure 7) and its properties (which follow from the fact that it is the inverse of the natural 
logarithmic function). 


426 .... CHAPTER 5 INTEGRALS 

Properties of the Exponential Function The exponential function f x  ex is an increasing 
continuous function with domain  and range 0, . Thus, ex  0 for all x. 
Also 

lim ex  0 lim ex 

So the x-axis is a horizontal asymptote of f x  e. 

We now verify that f has the other properties expected of an exponential function.

Since ln is a one-to-one function, it follows that eey  e. 

Laws 2 and 3 are proved similarly (see Exercises 6 and 7). As we will soon see, 
Law 3 actually holds when r is any real number. 

We now prove the differentiation formula for ex .

Proof The function y  ex is differentiable because it is the inverse function of y  ln x,

the inverse function method. Let y  ex. Then ln y  x and, differentiating this latter

The function f x  ais called the exponential function with base a. Notice that ais

Definition 13 allows us to extend one of the laws of logarithms. We already know that 
lnar   r ln a when r is rational. But if we now let r be any real number we have, from 
Definition 13, 

r ln a   r ln a

Thus

General Logarithmic Functions

If a  0 and a  1, then f x  ais a one-to-one function. Its inverse function is called 
the logarithmic function with base a and is denoted by loga. Thus 

17 
logax  y &? ay  x 

In particular, we see that 

logex  ln x 

The laws of logarithms are similar to those for the natural logarithm and can be deduced 
from the laws of exponents (see Exercise 10). 

To differentiate y  logax, we write the equation as ay  x. From Equation 14 we have 
y ln a  ln x, so 

ln x 

logax  y 

Since ln a is a constant, we can differentiate as follows:

PROBLEMS 
PLUS 
|||| The principles of problem solving are 
discussed on page 80. 

|||| Another approach is to use l’Hospital’s Rule. 

Before you look at the solution of the following example, cover it up and first try to solve 
the problem yourself. 

xx sin t

EXAMPLE 1 Evaluate lim  y dt	. 

x l3 x  33 t 

SOLUTION Let’s start by having a preliminary look at the ingredients of the function. What 
happens to the first factor, x x  3, when x approaches 3? The numerator approaches 3 
and the denominator approaches 0, so we have 

xx

l  as x l 3 and l  as x l 3 

x  3 x  3 

x
x
3

The second factor approaches 3 sin ttdt , which is 0. It’s not clear what happens to the 
function as a whole. (One factor is becoming large while the other is becoming small.) 
So how do we proceed? 

One of the principles of problem solving is recognizing something familiar. Is there a 
part of the function that reminds us of something we’ve seen before? Well, the integral 
x sin t 

y dt 

3 t 

has x as its upper limit of integration and that type of integral occurs in Part 1 of the 
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: 

dx 

y f t dt  f  x 

dx a 

This suggests that differentiation might be involved. 

Once we start thinking about differentiation, the denominator x  3 reminds us of 
something else that should be familiar: One of the forms of the definition of the derivative 
in Chapter 2 is 

Fx  Fa 

Fa  lim 

x l ax  a 

and with a  3 this becomes 
Fx  F3 

F3  lim 

x l3 x  3 
So what is the function F in our situation? Notice that if we define 
x sin t 

Fx  y dt 

3 t 

then F3  0. What about the factor x in the numerator? That’s just a red herring, so 
let’s factor it out and put together the calculation: 
x sin t 
xx sin t 3 t

Applications of Integration 



In this chapter we explore some of the applications of the 
definite integral by using it to compute areas between 
curves, volumes of solids, and the work done by a varying 

force. The common theme is the following general method, 
which is similar to the one we used to find areas under 
curves: We break up a quantity Q into a large number of small parts. We next 
approximate each small part by a quantity of the form f x*i  x and thus approximate 
Q by a Riemann sum. Then we take the limit and express Q as an integral. 
Finally we evaluate the integral using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus or the 
Midpoint Rule.

In Chapter 5 we defined and calculated areas of regions that lie under the graphs of 
functions. Here we use integrals to find areas of regions that lie between the graphs of two 
functions. 

Consider the region S that lies between two curves y  f x and y  tx and between 
the vertical lines x  a and x  b, where f and t are continuous functions and 
f x  tx for all x in a, b. (See Figure 1.) 

Just as we did for areas under curves in Section 5.1, we divide S into n strips of equal 
width and then we approximate the ith strip by a rectangle with base x and height 
f x*i   tx* i . (See Figure 2. If we like, we could take all of the sample points to be right 
endpoints, in which case x* i  xi.) The Riemann sum

is therefore an approximation to what we intuitively think of as the area of S.

We recognize the limit in (1) as the definite integral of f  t. Therefore, we have the 
following formula for area.

Notice that in the special case where tx  0, S is the region under the graph of f 

and our general definition of area (1) reduces to our previous definition (Definition 2 in 

Section 5.1). 

In the case where both f and t are positive, you can see from Figure 3 why (2) is true:

EXAMPLE 1 Find the area of the region bounded above by y  ex, bounded below by 
y  x, and bounded on the sides by x  0 and x  1. 

SOLUTION The region is shown in Figure 4. The upper boundary curve is y  ex and the 
lower boundary curve is y  x. So we use the area formula (2) with fx  ex , tx  x, 
a  0, and b  1:

In Figure 4 we drew a typical approximating rectangle with width x as a reminder of 
the procedure by which the area is defined in (1). In general, when we set up an integral 
for an area, it’s helpful to sketch the region to identify the top curve yT, the bottom curve 
yB, and a typical approximating rectangle as in Figure 5. Then the area of a typical rectangle 
is yT  yB x and the equation

summarizes the procedure of adding (in a limiting sense) the areas of all the typical 
b rectangles.

Notice that in Figure 5 the left-hand boundary reduces to a point, whereas in Figure 3 

the right-hand boundary reduces to a point. In the next example both of the side bound


aries reduce to a point, so the first step is to find a and b. 

EXAMPLE 2 Find the area of the region enclosed by the parabolas y  x2 and 
y  2x  x2. 

SOLUTION We first find the points of intersection of the parabolas by solving their equa2 
 2x  x22  2x  0

tions simultaneously. This gives x, or 2x. Thus 2xx  1  0, 
so x  0 or 1. The points of intersection are 0, 0 and 1, 1.

Sometimes it’s difficult, or even impossible, to find the points of intersection of two 
curves exactly. As shown in the following example, we can use a graphing calculator or 
computer to find approximate values for the intersection points and then proceed as before.

This looks like a very difficult equation to solve exactly (in fact, it’s impossible), so 
instead we use a graphing device to draw the graphs of the two curves in Figure 7. One 
intersection point is the origin. We zoom in toward the other point of intersection and 
find that . (If greater accuracy is required, we could use Newton’s method or a 
rootfinder, if available on our graphing device.) Thus, an approximation to the area

EXAMPLE 4 Figure 8 shows velocity curves for two cars, A and B, that start side by side 
and move along the same road. What does the area between the curves represent? Use 
the Midpoint Rule to estimate it. 

SOLUTION We know from Section 5.4 that the area under the velocity curve A represents 
the distance traveled by car A during the first 16 seconds. Similarly, the area under curve 
B is the distance traveled by car B during that time period. So the area between these 
curves, which is the difference of the areas under the curves, is the distance between the 
cars after 16 seconds. We read the velocities from the graph and convert them to feet per

intervals are t1  2, t2  6, t3  10, and t4  14. We estimate the distance between the

If we are asked to find the area between the curves y  f x and y  tx where 
f x tx for some values of x but tx f x for other values of x, then we split the 
given region S into several regions S1, S2,... with areas A1, A2,...as shown in Figure 9. 
We then define the area of the region S to be the sum of the areas of the smaller regions 
S1, S2,..., that is, A  A1 A2 			 . Since

FIGURE 2 

In trying to find the volume of a solid we face the same type of problem as in finding areas. 
We have an intuitive idea of what volume means, but we must make this idea precise by 
using calculus to give an exact definition of volume. 

We start with a simple type of solid called a cylinder (or, more precisely, a right cylinder). 
As illustrated in Figure 1(a), a cylinder is bounded by a plane region B1, called the 
base, and a congruent region B2 in a parallel plane. The cylinder consists of all points on 
line segments that are perpendicular to the base and join B1 to B2. If the area of the base is 
A and the height of the cylinder (the distance from B1 to B2) is h, then the volume V of the 
cylinder is defined as 

V  Ah 

In particular, if the base is a circle with radius r, then the cylinder is a circular cylinder with 
volume V  r2h [see Figure 1(b)], and if the base is a rectangle with length l and width 
w, then the cylinder is a rectangular box (also called a rectangular parallelepiped) with 
volume V  lwh [see Figure 1(c)].

For a solid S that isn’t a cylinder we first “cut” S into pieces and approximate each piece 
by a cylinder. We estimate the volume of S by adding the volumes of the cylinders. We 
arrive at the exact volume of S through a limiting process in which the number of pieces 
becomes large. 

We start by intersecting S with a plane and obtaining a plane region that is called a 
cross-section of S. Let Ax be the area of the cross-section of S in a plane Px perpendicular 
to the x-axis and passing through the point x, where a  x  b. (See Figure 2. 
Think of slicing S with a knife through x and computing the area of this slice.) The crosssectional 
area Ax will vary as x increases from a to b.

Let’s divide S into n “slabs” of equal width x by using the planes P, P,...to slice 

x1 x2 
the solid. (Think of slicing a loaf of bread.) If we choose sample points x* i in xi1, xi , we 
can approximate the th slab Si (the part of S that lies between the planes Pand P

i ) by 
a cylinder with base area Ax*i and “height” x. (See Figure 3.)

The volume of this cylinder is Ax*i x, so an approximation to our intuitive conception

what we think of intuitively as the volume):

This approximation appears to become better and better as n l . (Think of the slices as 
becoming thinner and thinner.) Therefore, we define the volume as the limit of these sums 
as n l . But we recognize the limit of Riemann sums as a definite integral and so we 
have the following definition. 

Definition of Volume Let S be a solid that lies between x  a and x  b. If the cross

sectional area of S in the plane Px, through x and perpendicular to the x-axis, is 

pendent of how S is situated with respect to the 

Ax, where A is a continuous function, then the volume of S is 

x-axis. In other words, no matter how we slice S 

with parallel planes, we always get the same n 

answer for V. V  lim Ax*i x  y bAxdx

When we use the volume formula V  xab Axdx it is important to remember that 
Axis the area of a moving cross-section obtained by slicing through x perpendicular to 
the -axis.

x 
Notice that, for a cylinder, the cross-sectional area is constant: Ax A for all x. So our 
definition of volume gives V  xab A dx  Ab  a; this agrees with the formula V  Ah.

(The integrand is even.) 
Figure 5 illustrates the definition of volume when the solid is a sphere with radius 
. From the result of Example 1, we know that the volume of the sphere is 
. Here the slabs are circular cylinders, or disks, and the three parts of Figure 
5 show the geometric interpretations of the Riemann sums 
when n  5, 10, and 20 if we choose the sample points to be the midpoints . Notice 
that as we increase the number of approximating cylinders, the corresponding Riemann 
sums become closer to the true volume. 
EXAMPLE 2 Find the volume of the solid obtained by rotating about the x-axis the region 
under the curve from 0 to 1. Illustrate the definition of volume by sketching a 
typical approximating cylinder. 
SOLUTION The region is shown in Figure 6(a). If we rotate about the x-axis, we get the 
solid shown in Figure 6(b). When we slice through the point x, we get a disk with radius

solid perpendicular to the y-axis and therefore to integrate with respect to y. If we slice

SOLUTION The curves y  x and y  x2 intersect at the points 0, 0 and 1, 1. The region 
between them, the solid of rotation, and a cross-section perpendicular to the x-axis are 
shown in Figure 8. A cross-section in the plane Px has the shape of a washer (an annular 
ring) with inner radius x2 and outer radius x, so we find the cross-sectional area by subtracting 
the area of the inner circle from the area of the outer circle:

Some of the pioneers of calculus, such as Kepler and Newton, 
were inspired by the problem of finding the volumes of wine 
barrels. (In fact Kepler published a book Stereometria doliorum 
in 1715 devoted to methods for finding the volumes of barrels.) 
They often approximated the shape of the sides by parabolas.

Some volume problems are very difficult to handle by the methods of the preceding section. 
For instance, let’s consider the problem of finding the volume of the solid obtained 
by rotating about the y-axis the region bounded by y  2x2  x3 and y  0. (See Figure 1.) 
If we slice perpendicular to the y-axis, we get a washer. But to compute the inner radius 
and the outer radius of the washer, we would have to solve the cubic equation 
y  2x2  x3 for x in terms of y; that’s not easy. 

Fortunately, there is a method, called the method of cylindrical shells, that is easier to 
use in such a case. Figure 2 shows a cylindrical shell with inner radius r1, outer radius r2, 
and height h. Its volume V is calculated by subtracting the volume V1 of the inner cylinder 
from the volume V2 of the outer cylinder:

If we let r  r2  r1 (the thickness of the shell) and r  21 r2  r1 (the average radius 
of the shell), then this formula for the volume of a cylindrical shell becomes

and it can be remembered as

Now let S be the solid obtained by rotating about the y-axis the region bounded by 
y  f x [where f x 	 0], y  0, x  a, and x  b, where b  a 	 0. (See Figure 3.)

We divide the interval a, b into n subintervals xi1, xi  of equal width x and let xi be 
the midpoint of the ith subinterval. If the rectangle with base xi1, xi  and height fxi  is 
rotated about the y-axis, then the result is a cylindrical shell with average radius xi, height 
fxi , and thickness x (see Figure 4), so by Formula 1 its volume is 

Vi  2xi  fxi  x 

Therefore, an approximation to the volume V of S is given by the sum of the volumes of 
these shells: 

nn 

V  Vi   

2xi fxi  x

The argument using cylindrical shells makes Formula 2 seem reasonable, but later we 
will be able to prove it (see Exercise 65 in Section 7.1). 

The best way to remember Formula 2 is to think of a typical shell, cut and flattened as 

in Figure 5, with radius x, circumference

NOTE  Comparing the solution of Example 1 with the remarks at the beginning of this 
section, we see that the method of cylindrical shells is much easier than the washer method 
for this problem. We did not have to find the coordinates of the local maximum and we did 
not have to solve the equation of the curve for in terms of . However, in other examples 
the methods of the preceding section may be easier.

|||| 6.4 Work 


The term work is used in everyday language to mean the total amount of effort required to 
perform a task. In physics it has a technical meaning that depends on the idea of a force. 
Intuitively, you can think of a force as describing a push or pull on an object—for example, 
a horizontal push of a book across a table or the downward pull of the Earth’s gravity on 
a ball. In general, if an object moves along a straight line with position function st, then 
the force F on the object (in the same direction) is defined by Newton’s Second Law of 
Motion as the product of its mass m and its acceleration: 

1 
d2s 

F  m 

dt2 

In the SI metric system, the mass is measured in kilograms (kg), the displacement in 
meters (m), the time in seconds (s), and the force in newtons ( N  kg
m
s2). Thus, a force 

2

of 1 N acting on a mass of 1 kg produces an acceleration of 1 m
s . In the U.S. Customary 
system the fundamental unit is chosen to be the unit of force, which is the pound. 

In the case of constant acceleration, the force F is also constant and the work done is 
defined to be the product of the force F and the distance d that the object moves: 

2 
W  Fd work  force 	 distance 

If F is measured in newtons and d in meters, then the unit for W is a newton-meter, which 
is called a joule (J). If F is measured in pounds and d in feet, then the unit for W is a footpound 
(ft-lb), which is about 1.36 J. 

EXAMPLE 1 

(a) How much work is done in lifting a 1.2-kg book off the floor to put it on a desk that 
is 0.7 m high? Use the fact that the acceleration due to gravity is t  9.8 m
s.2 
(b) How much work is done in lifting a 20-lb weight 6 ft off the ground? 
SOLUTION 

(a) The force exerted is equal and opposite to that exerted by gravity, so Equation 1 
gives 
F  mt  1.29.8  11.76 N 
and then Equation 2 gives the work done as 

W  Fd  11.760.7 8.2 J 

(b) Here the force is given as F  20 lb, so the work done is 
W  Fd  20  6  120 ft-lb 

Notice that in part (b), unlike part (a), we did not have to multiply by t because we 
were given the weight (which is a force) and not the mass of the object. 

Equation 2 defines work as long as the force is constant, but what happens if the force 
is variable? Let’s suppose that the object moves along the x-axis in the positive direction, 
from x  a to x  b, and at each point x between a and b a force f x acts on the object, 
where f is a continuous function. We divide the interval a, b into n subintervals with endpoints 
x0, x1, ..., xn and equal width x. We choose a sample point x* i in the ith subinterval 
xi1, xi . Then the force at that point is f x*i . If n is large, then x is small, and

SECTION 6.4 WORK .... 461 

since f is continuous, the values of f don’t change very much over the interval xi1, xi . 
In other words, f is almost constant on the interval and so the work Wi that is done in moving 
the particle from xi1 to xi is approximately given by Equation 2: 

Wi  fx*i  x 

Thus, we can approximate the total work by

3 
W  fx*i  x

It seems that this approximation becomes better as we make n larger. Therefore, we define 
the work done in moving the object from a to b as the limit of this quantity as n l . 
Since the right side of (3) is a Riemann sum, we recognize its limit as being a definite integral 
and so

The work done is 1623 ft-lb. 


In the next example we use a law from physics: Hooke’s Law states that the force 
required to maintain a spring stretched x units beyond its natural length is proportional 
to :

x 
fx  kx 


where k is a positive constant (called the spring constant). Hooke’s Law holds provided 
that x is not too large (see Figure 1). 

EXAMPLE 3 A force of 40 N is required to hold a spring that has been stretched from its 
natural length of 10 cm to a length of 15 cm. How much work is done in stretching the 
spring from 15 cm to 18 cm? 

SOLUTION According to Hooke’s Law, the force required to hold the spring stretched x 
meters beyond its natural length is fx  kx. When the spring is stretched from 10 cm 
to 15 cm, the amount stretched is 5 cm  0.05 m. This means that f0.05  40, so 

0.05k  40 k  40 

0.05  800 
Thus, fx  800x and the work done in stretching the spring from 15 cm to 18 cm is

ing. How much work is required to lift the cable to the top of the building? 

SOLUTION Here we don’t have a formula for the force function, but we can use an argument 
similar to the one that led to Definition 4. 

Let’s place the origin at the top of the building and the x-axis pointing downward as 

x* i 

in Figure 2. We divide the cable into small parts with length x. If x* i is a point in the 
ith such interval, then all points in the interval are lifted by approximately the same 
amount, namely x* i . The cable weighs 2 pounds per foot, so the weight of the ith part is 

2x. Thus, the work done on the ith part, in foot-pounds, is 

FIGURE 2

nate line as in Figure 3. The water extends from a depth of 2 m to a depth of 10 m and 
so we divide the interval 2, 10into n subintervals with endpoints x0, x1, ..., xn and 
choose x* i in the th subinterval. This divides the water into ni

i layers. The th layer is 

approximated by a circular cylinder with radius ri and height x. We can compute ri

The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals is a consequence of the Mean Value Theorem

Suppose we are planning to make a taco from a round tortilla with diameter 8 inches by bending 
the tortilla so that it is shaped as if it is partially wrapped around a circular cylinder. We 
will fill the tortilla to the edge (but no more) with meat, cheese, and other ingredients. Our 
problem is to decide how to curve the tortilla in order to maximize the volume of food it can 
hold.

In this chapter we develop techniques for using these basic integration formulas 
to obtain indefinite integrals of more complicated functions. We learned the most 
important method of integration, the Substitution Rule, in Section 5.5. The other general 
technique, integration by parts, is presented in Section 7.1. Then we learn 
methods that are special to particular classes of functions such as trigonometric functions 
and rational functions. 

Integration is not as straightforward as differentiation; there are no rules that 

absolutely guarantee obtaining an indefinite integral of a function. Therefore, in 

Section 7.5 we discuss a strategy for integration. 

|||| 7.1 Integration by Parts 

Every differentiation rule has a corresponding integration rule. For instance, the Substitution 
Rule for integration corresponds to the Chain Rule for differentiation. The rule that 
corresponds to the Product Rule for differentiation is called the rule for integration by 
parts. 

The Product Rule states that if f and t are differentiable functions, then

In the notation for indefinite integrals this equation becomes 

y  fxtx  txfx dx  fxtx 

or y fxtx dx  ytxfx dx  fxtx 

We can rearrange this equation as 

1 
y fxtx dx  fxtx  ytxfx dx 

Formula 1 is called the formula for integration by parts. It is perhaps easier to remember 
in the following notation. Let u  fx and v  tx. Then the differentials are 
du  fx dx and dv  tx dx, so, by the Substitution Rule, the formula for integration 
by parts becomes

EXAMPLE 1 Find .y x sin x dx 
SOLUTION USING FORMULA 1 Suppose we choose and . Then

SECTION 7.1 INTEGRATION BY PARTS .... 477 



NOTE Our aim in using integration by parts is to obtain a simpler integral than the one 
we started with. Thus, in Example 1 we started with x x sin x dx and expressed it in terms 
of the simpler integral x cos x dx . If we had chosen u  sin x and dv  x dx , then 
du  cos x dx and v  x2	2, so integration by parts gives 

x21 2

y x sin x dx  sin x  y xcos x dx 

22 

Although this is true, x x2 cos x dx is a more difficult integral than the one we started with. 
In general, when deciding on a choice for u and dv, we usually try to choose u  fx to 
be a function that becomes simpler when differentiated (or at least not more complicated) 
as long as dv  tx dx can be readily integrated to give v. 

EXAMPLE 2 Evaluate y ln x dx . 

SOLUTION Here we don’t have much choice for u and dv. Let 

u  ln xdv  dx 

1 

Then du  dx v  x 

x 

Integrating by parts, we get 

dx 

y ln x dx  x ln x  y x 

x 

 x ln x  y dx 

 x ln x  x  C 

Integration by parts is effective in this example because the derivative of the function 
fx  ln x is simpler than f. 


EXAMPLE 3 Find y t2et dt. 

t2 t

SOLUTION Notice that becomes simpler when differentiated (whereas eis unchanged 
when differentiated or integrated), so we choose 

u  t2 

dv  et dt 

Then du  2tdt v  et 

Integration by parts gives 

3 
y t2et dt  t2et  2 y tet dt 

The integral that we obtained, x tet dt, is simpler than the original integral but is still not 
obvious. Therefore, we use integration by parts a second time, this time with u  t and

is given in Exercise 48 in Appendix G.

 t2et  2tet  2et  C1 where C1  2C 


EXAMPLE 4 Evaluate y ex sin x dx . 

SOLUTION Neither ex nor sin x becomes simpler when differentiated, but we try choosing 
u  ex and dv  sin x dx anyway. Then du  ex dx and v  cos x, so integration by 
parts gives 

4 
y ex sin x dx  ex cos x  y ex cos x dx 

The integral that we have obtained, x ex cos x dx , is no simpler than the original one, but 
at least it’s no more difficult. Having had success in the preceding example integrating 
by parts twice, we persevere and integrate by parts again. This time we use u  ex and 
dv  cos x dx . Then du  ex dx, v  sin x, and 

5 
y ex cos x dx  ex sin x  y ex sin x dx 

At first glance, it appears as if we have accomplished nothing because we have arrived at 
x ex sin x dx , which is where we started. However, if we put Equation 5 into Equation 4 
we get 

y ex sin x dx  ex cos x  ex sin x  y ex sin x dx 

This can be regarded as an equation to be solved for the unknown integral. Adding 
x ex sin x dx to both sides, we obtain 

2 y ex sin x dx  ex cos x  ex sin x 

Dividing by 2 and adding the constant of integration, we get 

y ex sin x dx  12 exsin x  cos x  C 


If we combine the formula for integration by parts with Part 2 of the Fundamental 
Theorem of Calculus, we can evaluate definite integrals by parts. Evaluating both sides of 
Formula 1 between a and b, assuming f and t are continuous, and using the Fundamental

|||| 7.2 Trigonometric Integrals 

In this section we use trigonometric identities to integrate certain combinations of trigonometric 
functions. We start with powers of sine and cosine. 

EXAMPLE 1 Evaluate y cos3x dx . 

SOLUTION Simply substituting u  cos x isn’t helpful, since then du  sin x dx . In order 
to integrate powers of cosine, we would need an extra sin x factor. Similarly, a power of 
sine would require an extra cos x factor. Thus, here we can separate one cosine factor 
and convert the remaining cos2x factor to an expression involving sine using the identity 
sin2x cos2x  1: 

cos3x  cos2x  cos x  1 sin2x cos x 

We can then evaluate the integral by substituting u  sin x, so du  cos x dx and 

y cos3x dx  y cos2x  cos x dx  y 1 sin2x cos x dx

SECTION 7.2 TRIGONOMETRIC INTEGRALS .... 483 

In general, we try to write an integrand involving powers of sine and cosine in a form 
where we have only one sine factor (and the remainder of the expression in terms of 
cosine) or only one cosine factor (and the remainder of the expression in terms of sine). 
The identity sin2x  cos2x  1 enables us to convert back and forth between even powers 
of sine and cosine. 

EXAMPLE 2 Find y sin5x cos2x dx 

SOLUTION We could convert cos2x to 1  sin2x, but we would be left with an expression in 
terms of sin x with no extra cos x factor. Instead, we separate a single sine factor and 
rewrite the remaining sin4x factor in terms of cos x: 

sin5x cos2x  sin2x2 cos2x sin x  1  cos2x2 cos2x sin x 

Substituting u  cos x, we have du  sin x dx and so

In the preceding examples, an odd power of sine or cosine enabled us to separate a 
single factor and convert the remaining even power. If the integrand contains even powers 
of both sine and cosine, this strategy fails. In this case, we can take advantage of the following 
half-angle identities (see Equations 17b and 17a in Appendix D):

To summarize, we list guidelines to follow when evaluating integrals of the form 
x sinmx cosnx dx , where m  0 and n  0 are integers. 

Strategy for Evaluating y sinmx cosnx dx 

(a) If the power of cosine is odd n  2k  1, save one cosine factor and use 
cos2x  1  sin2x to express the remaining factors in terms of sine: 
y sinmx cos2k1x dx  y sinmx cos2xk cos x dx 

 y sinmx 1  sin2xk cos x dx 

Then substitute u  sin x. 

(b) If the power of sine is odd m  2k  1, save one sine factor and use 
sin2x  1  cos2x to express the remaining factors in terms of cosine: 
n

y sin2k1x cosnx dx  y sin2xk cosx sin x dx 

 y 1  cos2xk cosnx sin x dx 

Then substitute u  cos x. [Note that if the powers of both sine and cosine are 
odd, either (a) or (b) can be used.] 

(c) If the powers of both sine and cosine are even, use the half-angle identities 
sin2x  21 1  cos 2x cos2x  21 1  cos 2x 

It is sometimes helpful to use the identity 

sin x cos x  12sin 2x 


SECTION 7.2 TRIGONOMETRIC INTEGRALS .... 485 

We can use a similar strategy to evaluate integrals of the form x tanmx secnx dx . Since 
ddx tan x  sec2x, we can separate a sec2x factor and convert the remaining (even) 
power of secant to an expression involving tangent using the identity sec2x  1  tan2x. 
Or, since ddx sec x  sec x tan x, we can separate a sec x tan x factor and convert the 
remaining (even) power of tangent to secant. 

EXAMPLE 5 Evaluate y tan6x sec4x dx . 

SOLUTION If we separate one sec2x factor, we can express the remaining sec2x factor in 
terms of tangent using the identity sec2x  1  tan2x. We can then evaluate the integral 
by substituting u  tan x with du  sec2x dx : 

y tan6x sec4x dx  y tan6x sec2x sec2x dx

The preceding examples demonstrate strategies for evaluating integrals of the form 
x tanmx secnx dx for two cases, which we summarize here. 


486 .... CHAPTER 7 TECHNIQUES OF INTEGRATION 

Strategy for Evaluating y tanmx secnx dx 

(a) If the power of secant is even n  2k, k  2, save a factor of sec2x and use 
sec2x  1  tan2x to express the remaining factors in terms of tan x: 
2xk1

y tanmx sec2kx dx  y tanmx secsec2x dx 

xk1

 y tanmx 1  tan2sec2x dx 

Then substitute u  tan x. 

(b) If the power of tangent is odd m  2k  1, save a factor of sec x tan x and 
use tan2x  sec2x  1 to express the remaining factors in terms of sec x: 
y tan2k1x secnx dx  y tan2xk secn1x sec x tan x dx 

 y sec2x  1k secn1x sec x tan x dx 

Then substitute u  sec x. 

For other cases, the guidelines are not as clear-cut. We may need to use identities, integration 
by parts, and occasionally a little ingenuity. We will sometimes need to be able to 
integrate tan x by using the formula established in (5.5.5): 

y tan x dx  ln 	 sec x	  C 

We will also need the indefinite integral of secant: 

1 
y sec x dx  ln 	 sec x  tan x	  C 

We could verify Formula 1 by differentiating the right side, or as follows. First we multiply 
numerator and denominator by sec x  tan x: 

sec x  tan x 

y sec x dx  y sec x dx 

sec x  tan x 

2

secx  sec x tan x 

 y dx 

sec x  tan x 

If we substitute u  sec x  tan x, then du  sec x tan x  sec2x dx, so the integral 
becomes x 1u du  ln 	 u	  C. Thus, we have 

y sec x dx  ln 	 sec x  tan x	  C 


|||| These product identities are discussed in 
Appendix D. 

SECTION 7.2 TRIGONOMETRIC INTEGRALS .... 487 

EXAMPLE 7 Find y tan3x dx . 
SOLUTION Here only tan x occurs, so we use tan2x  sec2x  1 to rewrite a tan2x factor in 
terms of sec2x: 
y tan3x dx  y tan x tan2x dx 
 y tan x sec2x  1 dx 
 y tan x sec2x dx  y tan x dx 
tan2x 

  ln 	 sec x	  C 

2 
In the first integral we mentally substituted u  tan x so that du  sec2x dx . 
If an even power of tangent appears with an odd power of secant, it is helpful to express 
the integrand completely in terms of sec x. Powers of sec x may require integration by 

parts, as shown in the following example. 
EXAMPLE 8 Find .y sec3x dx 
SOLUTION Here we integrate by parts with 
du  sec x tan x dx 
u  sec x 
v  tan x 
dv  sec2x dx 

Then y sec3x dx  sec x tan x  y sec x tan2x dx 

 sec x tan x  y sec x sec2x  1 dx 

 sec x tan x  y sec3x dx  y sec x dx 

Using Formula 1 and solving for the required integral, we get 

y sec3x dx  1 (sec x tan x  ln 	 sec x  tan x	)  C

2 

Integrals such as the one in the preceding example may seem very special but they 
occur frequently in applications of integration, as we will see in Chapter 8. Integrals of 
the form x cotmx cscnx dx can be found by similar methods because of the identity 
1  cot2x  csc2x. 

Finally, we can make use of another set of trigonometric identities: 

2 
To evaluate the integrals (a) x sin mx cos nx dx , (b) x sin mx sin nx dx , or 
(c) x cos mx cos nx dx , use the corresponding identity: 
(a) sin A cos B  12 sinA  B  sinA  B 
(b) sin A sin B  12 cosA  B  cosA  B

In finding the area of a circle or an ellipse, an integral of the form xsa2 x2 dx arises, 
where a 0. If it were x xsa2 x2 dx, the substitution u  a2 x2 would be effective 

x to 

by

but, as it stands, xsa2 x2 dx is more difficult. If we change the variable from 

, then the identity 
1 sin2

 cos

2

the substitution x  a sin 

allows us to get rid of the 

root sign because 

 a 

cos

sa2 x2  sa2 a2 sin2

 sa21 sin2  sa2 cos2

Notice the difference between the substitution u  a2 x2 (in which the new variable is 

a function of the old one) and the substitution x  a sin 

(the old variable is a function of 

the new one). 

In general we can make a substitution of the form x  tt by using the Substitution 
Rule in reverse. To make our calculations simpler, we assume that t has an inverse function; 
that is, t is one-to-one. In this case, if we replace u by x and x by t in the Substitution 
Rule (Equation 5.5.4), we obtain 

y f x dx  y f ttt
t dt 

This kind of substitution is called inverse substitution.

function. This can be accomplished by restricting 

. 


In the following table we list trigonometric substitutions that are effective for the given 
radical expressions because of the specified trigonometric identities. In each case the restric


tion on 

is imposed to ensure that the function that defines the substitution is one-to-one. 

(These are the same intervals used in Appendix D in defining the inverse functions.)

|||| 7.4 Integration of Rational Functions by Partial Fractions 

In this section we show how to integrate any rational function (a ratio of polynomials) by 
expressing it as a sum of simpler fractions, called partial fractions, that we already know 
how to integrate. To illustrate the method, observe that by taking the fractions 2x 1 
and 1x 2 to a common denominator we obtain 

2 12x 2 x 1 x 5 

x 1 x 2 x 1x 2 x2 x 2 

If we now reverse the procedure, we see how to integrate the function on the right side of 
this equation: 

x 5 21 

y dx  y   dx 

x2 x 2 x 1 x 2 
 2 ln  x 1  ln  x 2  C 

To see how the method of partial fractions works in general, let’s consider a rational 
function 

Px 

f x  

Qx 

where P and Q are polynomials. It’s possible to express f as a sum of simpler fractions 
provided that the degree of P is less than the degree of Q. Such a rational function is called 
proper. Recall that if 

n

Px  anxan1xn1 a1 x a0 

where an  0, then the degree of P is n and we write degP  n. 

If f is improper, that is, degP 
degQ, then we must take the preliminary step 

of dividing Q into P (by long division) until a remainder Rx is obtained such that 

degR degQ. The division statement is 

1 
Px Rx 

f x  Sx  

Qx Qx 

where S and R are also polynomials. 
As the following example illustrates, sometimes this preliminary step is all that is 

required.

is given in the note after this example. 

SECTION 7.4 INTEGRATION OF RATIONAL FUNCTIONS BY PARTIAL FRACTIONS .... 497 

The next step is to factor the denominator Qx as far as possible. It can be shown that 
any polynomial Q can be factored as a product of linear factors (of the form ax b) and 
irreducible quadratic factors (of the form ax2 bx c, where b2 4ac 0). For instance, 
if Qx  x4 16, we could factor it as 

Qx  x2 4x2 4  x 2x 2x2 4 

The third step is to express the proper rational function RxQx (from Equation 1) as 
a sum of partial fractions of the form 

A Ax B 
ax bi or 
ax2 bx cj 


A theorem in algebra guarantees that it is always possible to do this. We explain the details 
for the four cases that occur. 



CASE I The denominator Qx is a product of distinct linear factors. 

This means that we can write 

Qx  a1 x b1 a2 x b2  akx bk  

where no factor is repeated (and no factor is a constant multiple of another). In this case 
the partial fraction theorem states that there exist constants A1, A2, ..., Ak such that 

2 
Rx A1 A2 Ak

   

Qx a1 x b1 a2 x b2 akx bk 

These constants can be determined as in the following example. 

x2 2x 1 

EXAMPLE 2 Evaluate y dx. 

2x3 3x2 2x 

SOLUTION Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, 
we don’t need to divide. We factor the denominator as 

2x3 3x2 2x  x2x2 3x 2  x2x 1x 2 

Since the denominator has three distinct linear factors, the partial fraction decomposition 
of the integrand (2) has the form 

3 
x2 2x 1 AB C 

x2x 1x 2 x 2x 1 x 2 

To determine the values of A, B, and C, we multiply both sides of this equation by the 
product of the denominators, x2x 1x 2, obtaining 

4 
x2 2x 1  A2x 1x 2 Bxx 2 Cx2x 1 

Expanding the right side of Equation 4 and writing it in the standard form for polynomials, 
we get

FIGURE 1 

|||| We could check our work by taking the terms 
to a common denominator and adding them. 

The polynomials in Equation 5 are identical, so their coefficients must be equal. The 
coefficient of x2 on the right side, 2A  B  2C, must equal the coefficient of x2 on the 
left side—namely, 1. Likewise, the coefficients of x are equal and the constant terms are 
equal. This gives the following system of equations for A, B, and C: 

2A  B  2C  1 

3A  2B  C  2

2A  1

Solving, we get A  1, B  1, and C   1 , and so

2 ln  x  10 ln  2x  1   10 ln  x  2   K 

In integrating the middle term we have made the mental substitution u  2x  1, which 
gives du  2 dx and dx  du2. 



NOTE We can use an alternative method to find the coefficients A, B, and C in 
Example 2. Equation 4 is an identity; it is true for every value of x. Let’s choose values of 
x that simplify the equation. If we put x  0 in Equation 4, then the second and third terms 
on the right side vanish and the equation then becomes 2A  1, or A  12. Likewise, 
x  1 gives 5B4  1 and x  2 gives 10C  1, so B  1 and C   1 . (You may object 

2 4 510 

that Equation 3 is not valid for x  0, 12, or 2, so why should Equation 4 be valid for those 
values? In fact, Equation 4 is true for all values of x, even x  0, 21, and 2. See Exercise 67 
for the reason.)

CASE II Qx is a product of linear factors, some of which are repeated. 

Suppose the first linear factor a1 x b1 is repeated r times; that is, a1 x b1r occurs in 
the factorization of Qx. Then instead of the single term A1a1 x b1 in Equation 2, we 
would use

x4 2x2 4x 1 

EXAMPLE 4 Find y dx.

x4 2x2 4x 14x 

 x 1  

x3 x2 x 1 x3 x2 x 1 

The second step is to factor the denominator Qx  x3 x2 x 1. Since Q1  0, 
we know that x 1 is a factor and we obtain

Since the linear factor x 1 occurs twice, the partial fraction decomposition is 
4x ABC

CASE III Qx contains irreducible quadratic factors, none of which is repeated. 

If Qx has the factor ax2  bx  c, where b2  4ac  0, then, in addition to the partial 
fractions in Equations 2 and 7, the expression for RxQx will have a term of the form

Ax  B

where A and B are constants to be determined. For instance, the function given by

As we have seen, integration is more challenging than differentiation. In finding the derivative 
of a function it is obvious which differentiation formula we should apply. But it may 
not be obvious which technique we should use to integrate a given function. 

Until now individual techniques have been applied in each section. For instance, we 
usually used substitution in Exercises 5.5, integration by parts in Exercises 7.1, and partial 
fractions in Exercises 7.4. But in this section we present a collection of miscellaneous integrals 
in random order and the main challenge is to recognize which technique or formula 
to use. No hard and fast rules can be given as to which method applies in a given situation, 
but we give some advice on strategy that you may find useful. 


506 .... CHAPTER 7 TECHNIQUES OF INTEGRATION 

A prerequisite for strategy selection is a knowledge of the basic integration formulas. 
In the following table we have collected the integrals from our previous list together with 
several additional formulas that we have learned in this chapter. Most of them should be 
memorized. It is useful to know them all, but the ones marked with an asterisk need not be 
memorized since they are easily derived. Formula 19 can be avoided by using partial fractions, 
and trigonometric substitutions can be used in place of Formula 20.

Once you are armed with these basic integration formulas, if you don’t immediately see 
how to attack a given integral, you might try the following four-step strategy. 

1. Simplify the Integrand if Possible Sometimes the use of algebraic manipulation or 
trigonometric identities will simplify the integrand and make the method of integration 
obvious. Here are some examples:

y sin x  cos x2 dx  y sin2x  2 sin x cos x  cos2x dx 

 y 1  2 sin x cos x dx 

2. Look for an Obvious Substitution Try to find some function u  tx in the integrand 
whose differential du  tx dx also occurs, apart from a constant factor. 
For instance, in the integral 
x 

y dx 

x2  1 

we notice that if u  x2  1, then du  2x dx . Therefore, we use the substitution 
u  x2  1 instead of the method of partial fractions. 

3. Classify the Integrand According to Its Form If Steps 1 and 2 have not led to the 
solution, then we take a look at the form of the integrand f x. 
(a) 
Trigonometric functions. If f x is a product of powers of sin x and cos x, 
of tan x and sec x, or of cot x and csc x, then we use the substitutions recommended 
in Section 7.2. 
(b) 
Rational functions. If f is a rational function, we use the procedure of Section 
7.4 involving partial fractions. 
(c) 
Integration by parts. If f x is a product of a power of x (or a polynomial) 
and a transcendental function (such as a trigonometric, exponential, or logarithmic 
function), then we try integration by parts, choosing u and dv according 
to the advice given in Section 7.1. If you look at the functions in Exercises 
7.1, you will see that most of them are the type just described. 
(d) 
Radicals. Particular kinds of substitutions are recommended when certain 
radicals appear. 
(i) If sx2  a2 occurs, we use a trigonometric substitution according to the 
table in Section 7.3. 
n 
n

(ii) If sax  b occurs, we use the rationalizing substitution u  sax  b. 
n

More generally, this sometimes works for stx. 

4. Try Again If the first three steps have not produced the answer, remember that 
there are basically only two methods of integration: substitution and parts. 
(a) 
Try substitution. Even if no substitution is obvious (Step 2), some inspiration 
or ingenuity (or even desperation) may suggest an appropriate substitution. 
(b) 
Try parts. Although integration by parts is used most of the time on products 
of the form described in Step 3(c), it is sometimes effective on single functions. 
Looking at Section 7.1, we see that it works on tan1x, sin1x, and ln x, 
and these are all inverse functions. 
(c) 
Manipulate the integrand. Algebraic manipulations (perhaps rationalizing the 
denominator or using trigonometric identities) may be useful in transforming 
the integral into an easier form. These manipulations may be more substantial 
than in Step 1 and may involve some ingenuity. Here is an example: 
dx 11  cos x 1  cos x 

y  y  dx  y dx 

1  cos x 1  cos x 1  cos x 1  cos2x

.... CHAPTER 7 TECHNIQUES OF INTEGRATION 

(d) 
Relate the problem to previous problems. When you have built up some experience 
in integration, you may be able to use a method on a given integral that 
is similar to a method you have already used on a previous integral. Or you 
may even be able to express the given integral in terms of a previous one. For 
instance, x tan2x sec x dx is a challenging integral, but if we make use of the 
identity tan2x  sec2x  1, we can write 
y tan2x sec x dx  y sec3x dx  y sec x dx 

and if x sec3x dx has previously been evaluated (see Example 8 in Section 7.2), 
then that calculation can be used in the present problem. 

(e) 
Use several methods. Sometimes two or three methods are required to evaluate 
an integral. The evaluation could involve several successive substitutions 
of different types, or it might combine integration by parts with one or more 
substitutions. 
In the following examples we indicate a method of attack but do not fully work out the 
integral. 

tan3x 

EXAMPLE 1 y dx

3

cosx 
In Step 1 we rewrite the integral: 

tan3x 

y dx  y tan3x sec3x dx 

3

cosx 

The integral is now of the form x tanmx secnx dx with m odd, so we can use the advice in 
Section 7.2. 
Alternatively, if in Step 1 we had written 

tan3x sin3x 1 sin3x 

y dx  y dx  y dx

3336

cosx cosx cosx cosx 

then we could have continued as follows with the substitution u  cos x: 

sin3x 1  cos2x 1  u2

EXAMPLE 2 y esx dx 

According to Step 3(d)(ii) we substitute u  sx. Then x  u2, so dx  2u du and 

y esx dx  2 y ueu du 

The integrand is now a product of u and the transcendental function eu so it can be integrated 
by parts.

EXAMPLE 3 y dx

No algebraic simplification or substitution is obvious, so Steps 1 and 2 don’t apply here. 
The integrand is a rational function so we apply the procedure of Section 7.4, remembering 
that the first step is to divide. 

dx 

EXAMPLE 4 y

Here Step 2 is all that is needed. We substitute u  ln x because its differential is 
du  dxx, which occurs in the integral.

EXAMPLE 5 dx 

1  x 
Although the rationalizing substitution 

u  1  x 
1  x 

works here [Step 3(d)(ii)], it leads to a very complicated rational function. An easier 
method is to do some algebraic manipulation [either as Step 1 or as Step 4(c)]. Multiplying 
numerator and denominator by s1  x, we have

Can We Integrate All Continuous Functions? 

The question arises: Will our strategy for integration enable us to find the integral of every 
continuous function? For example, can we use it to evaluate x ex 2 dx? The answer is no, at 
least not in terms of the functions that we are familiar with. 

The functions that we have been dealing with in this book are called elementary functions. 
These are the polynomials, rational functions, power functions xa , exponential 
functions ax , logarithmic functions, trigonometric and inverse trigonometric functions, 
hyperbolic and inverse hyperbolic functions, and all functions that can be obtained from 
these by the five operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and composition. 
For instance, the function 

x2  1 

sin 2x

fx    lncosh x  xe

x3  2x  1 

is an elementary function. 
If f is an elementary function, then f is an elementary function but x fx dx need not 

x

be an elementary function. Consider fx  e2. Since f is continuous, its integral exists, 
and if we define the function F by 

Fx  y xet 2 dt 

0 


510 .... CHAPTER 7 TECHNIQUES OF INTEGRATION 

|||| 7.5 Exercises 


then we know from Part 1 of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus that 

x

Fx  e2 

x

Thus, fx  e2 has an antiderivative F, but it has been proved that F is not an elementary 
function. This means that no matter how hard we try, we will never succeed in evaluating 
x ex 2 dx in terms of the functions we know. (In Chapter 11, however, we will see how 
to express x ex 2 dx as an infinite series.) The same can be said of the following integrals:

In fact, the majority of elementary functions don’t have elementary antiderivatives. You 
may be assured, though, that the integrals in the following exercises are all elementary 
functions.

|||| 7.6 Integration Using Tables and Computer Algebra Systems 

In this section we describe how to use tables and computer algebra systems to integrate 
functions that have elementary antiderivatives. You should bear in mind, though, that even 
the most powerful computer algebra systems can’t find explicit formulas for the antiderivatives 
of functions like ex 2 or the other functions described at the end of Section 7.5. 

Tables of Integrals 

Tables of indefinite integrals are very useful when we are confronted by an integral that is 
difficult to evaluate by hand and we don’t have access to a computer algebra system. A relatively 
brief table of 120 integrals, categorized by form, is provided on the Reference Pages 
at the back of the book. More extensive tables are available in CRC Standard Mathematical 
Tables and Formulae, 30th ed. by Daniel Zwillinger (Boca Raton, FL: CRC 
Press, 1995) (581 entries) or in Gradshteyn and Ryzhik’s Table of Integrals, Series, 
and Products, 6e (New York: Academic Press, 2000), which contains hundreds of pages of 
integrals. It should be remembered, however, that integrals do not often occur in exactly 
the form listed in a table. Usually we need to use substitution or algebraic manipulation to 
transform a given integral into one of the forms in the table. 

EXAMPLE 1 The region bounded by the curves y  arctan x, y  0, and x  1 is rotated 
about the y-axis. Find the volume of the resulting solid. 

SOLUTION Using the method of cylindrical shells, we see that the volume is

EXAMPLE 2 Use the Table of Integrals to find y dx. 

s5  4x2 

SOLUTION If we look at the section of the table entitled Forms involving sa2  u2, we see 
that the closest entry is number 34: 

u2 ua2 

y du   sa2  u2  sin1u  C 

sa2  u22 2a 

This is not exactly what we have, but we will be able to use it if we first make the substitution 
u  2x: 

x2 u22 du 1 u2 

y dx  y  y du 

s5  4x2 s5  u22 8 s5  u2 

Then we use Formula 34 with a2  5 (so a  s5): 

x21 u21 u 5 u 

y dx  y du   s5  u2  sin1  C

EXAMPLE 3 Use the Table of Integrals to find y x3 sin x dx . 

SOLUTION If we look in the section called Trigonometric Forms, we see that none of 
the entries explicitly includes a u3 factor. However, we can use the reduction formula 
in entry 84 with n  3: 

y x3 sin x dx  x3 cos x  3 y x2 cos x dx 

85. 
y un cos u du We now need to evaluate x x2 cos x dx . We can use the reduction formula in entry 85 
with n  2, followed by entry 82: 
 un sin u  n y un1 sin u du 

y x2 cos x dx  x2 sin x  2 y x sin x dx

Combining these calculations, we get

where C  3K. 

EXAMPLE 4 Use the Table of Integrals to find y xsx2  2x  4 dx. 
SOLUTION Since the table gives forms involving sa2  x2, sa2  x2, and sx2  a2, but 
not sax2  bx  c, we first complete the square: 
x2  2x  4  x  12  3 
If we make the substitution u  x  1 (so x  u  1), the integrand will involve the 
pattern sa2  u2: 
y xsx2  2x  4 dx  y u  1 su2  3 du 

 y usu2  3 du  ysu2  3 du 
The first integral is evaluated using the substitution t  u2  3: 

2

y usu2  3 du  12 yst dt  21  3 t32  31 u2  332 

For the second integral we use Formula 21 with a  s3: 
u 

ysu2  3 du  su2  3  23 ln(u  su2  3)

2 
Thus 

y xsx2  2x  4 dx

Computer Algebra Systems 

We have seen that the use of tables involves matching the form of the given integrand with 
the forms of the integrands in the tables. Computers are particularly good at matching patterns. 
And just as we used substitutions in conjunction with tables, a CAS can perform substitutions 
that transform a given integral into one that occurs in its stored formulas. So it 
isn’t surprising that computer algebra systems excel at integration. That doesn’t mean that 
integration by hand is an obsolete skill. We will see that a hand computation sometimes 
produces an indefinite integral in a form that is more convenient than a machine answer. 

To begin, let’s see what happens when we ask a machine to integrate the relatively 
simple function y  13x  2. Using the substitution u  3x  2, an easy calculation 
by hand gives 

1 

y dx  13 ln 	 3x  2 	  C 

3x  2 


514 .... CHAPTER 7 TECHNIQUES OF INTEGRATION 

|||| This is Equation 3.9.3. 

whereas Derive, Mathematica, and Maple all return the answer 

1 

3 ln3x  2 

The first thing to notice is that computer algebra systems omit the constant of integration. 
In other words, they produce a particular antiderivative, not the most general one. 
Therefore, when making use of a machine integration, we might have to add a constant. 
Second, the absolute value signs are omitted in the machine answer. That is fine if our 
problem is concerned only with values of x greater than 32 . But if we are interested in other 
values of x, then we need to insert the absolute value symbol. 

In the next example we reconsider the integral of Example 4, but this time we ask a 
machine for the answer. 

EXAMPLE 5 Use a computer algebra system to find y xsx2  2x  4 dx.

23 

This looks different from the answer we found in Example 4, but it is equivalent because 
the third term can be rewritten using the identity 

The resulting extra term 2 ln(1s3) can be absorbed into the constant of integration. 

arcsinh x  ln(x  sx2  1)

Mathematica combined the first two terms of Example 4 (and the Maple result) into a 
single term by factoring. 
Derive gives the answer

6 sx2  2x  4 2x2  x  5  2 ln(sx2  2x  4  x  1) 

The first term is like the first term in the Mathematica answer, and the second term is 

identical to the last term in Example 4.

EXAMPLE 6 Use a CAS to evaluate y xx.

SECTION 7.6 INTEGRATION USING TABLES AND COMPUTER ALGEBRA SYSTEMS .... 515 

It’s clear that both systems must have expanded x2  58 by the Binomial Theorem and 

then integrated each term. 

If we integrate by hand instead, using the substitution u  x2  5, we get 

|||| Derive and the TI-89/92 also give this answer. 
y xx2  58 dx  181 x2  59  C 

For most purposes, this is a more convenient form of the answer. 
EXAMPLE 7 Use a CAS to find y sin5x cos2x dx . 
SOLUTION In Example 2 in Section 7.2 we found that 


1 
132517

y sin5x cos2x dx  3 cosx  5 cosx  7 cosx  C 

Derive and Maple report the answer

7 sin4x cos3x  35 sin2x cos3x  105 cos3x 
whereas Mathematica produces 

F
51 3 1

64 cos x  192 cos 3x  320 cos 5x  448 cos 7x 

We suspect that there are trigonometric identities which show these three answers are 
equivalent. Indeed, if we ask Derive, Maple, and Mathematica to simplify their expressions 
using trigonometric identities, they ultimately produce the same form of the answer 
as in Equation 1.

and we note that F0  0. This expression could probably be simplified, but there’s no 

need to do so because a computer algebra system can graph this version of F as easily as 
any other version. A graph of F is shown in Figure 1. To locate the extreme values of F, 
we graph its derivative F  f in Figure 2 and observe that F has a local maximum

when x 	 2.3 and a local minimum when x 	 2.5. The graph of F  f  in Figure 2 

shows that F has inflection points when x 	 0.7, 1.3, 1.8, 2.4, 3.3, and 3.9.

There are two situations in which it is impossible to find the exact value of a definite 
integral. 

x
x
b

The first situation arises from the fact that in order to evaluate afx dx using the 
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus we need to know an antiderivative of f. Sometimes, 
however, it is difficult, or even impossible, to find an antiderivative (see Section 7.5). For 
example, it is impossible to evaluate the following integrals exactly: 

12 1 

y exdx ys1 x3 dx 

0 1 

The second situation arises when the function is determined from a scientific experi


ment through instrument readings or collected data. There may be no formula for the func


tion (see Example 5). 

In both cases we need to find approximate values of definite integrals. We already know 

one such method. Recall that the definite integral is defined as a limit of Riemann sums, 

so any Riemann sum could be used as an approximation to the integral: If we divide 
a, b 

y 


into n subintervals of equal length

If fx 0, then the integral represents an area and (1) represents an approximation of this

x* i  xi and we have

in most cases. 

In Example 1 we deliberately chose an integral whose value can be computed explicitly

The error in using an approximation is defined to be the amount that needs to be added to 
the approximation to make it exact. From the values in Example 1 we see that the errors 
in the Trapezoidal and Midpoint Rule approximations for n  5 are

We can make several observations from these tables: 

1. 
In all of the methods we get more accurate approximations when we increase the 
value of n. (But very large values of n result in so many arithmetic operations that 
we have to beware of accumulated round-off error.) 
2. 
The errors in the left and right endpoint approximations are opposite in sign and 
appear to decrease by a factor of about 2 when we double the value of n. 
3. 
The Trapezoidal and Midpoint Rules are much more accurate than the endpoint 
approximations. 
4. 
The errors in the Trapezoidal and Midpoint Rules are opposite in sign and appear 
to decrease by a factor of about 4 when we double the value of n. 
5. 
The size of the error in the Midpoint Rule is about half the size of the error in the 
Trapezoidal Rule. 
Figure 5 shows why we can usually expect the Midpoint Rule to be more accurate than 
the Trapezoidal Rule. The area of a typical rectangle in the Midpoint Rule is the same as 
the trapezoid ABCD whose upper side is tangent to the graph at P. The area of this trapezoid 
is closer to the area under the graph than is the area of the trapezoid AQRD used in

|||| K can be any number larger than all the 
values of  f x, but smaller values of K 
give better error bounds.

would suffice, but 41 is the smallest value for 
which the error bound formula can guarantee us 
accuracy to within 0.0001.

the Trapezoidal Rule. [The midpoint error (shaded red) is smaller than the trapezoidal error 
(shaded blue).] 
These observations are corroborated in the following error estimates, which are proved 
in books on numerical analysis. Notice that Observation 4 corresponds to the n2 in each 
2n2  4n2

denominator because . The fact that the estimates depend on the size of the 
second derivative is not surprising if you look at Figure 5, because f x measures how 
much the graph is curved. [Recall that f x measures how fast the slope of y  fx 
changes.]

Let’s apply this error estimate to the Trapezoidal Rule approximation in Example 1. If 
fx  1x, then fx  1x2 and f x  2x3. Since 1  x  2, we have 1x  1, so

Therefore, taking K  2, a  1, b  2, and n  5 in the error estimate (3), we see that 
22  131

 ET    	 0.006667 

1252 150 

Comparing this error estimate of 0.006667 with the actual error of about 0.002488, we see 
that it can happen that the actual error is substantially less than the upper bound for the 
error given by (3). 

EXAMPLE 2 How large should we take n in order to guarantee that the Trapezoidal and 
Midpoint Rule approximations for x12 1x dx are accurate to within 0.0001? 

SOLUTION We saw in the preceding calculation that  f x  2 for 1  x  2, so we can 
take K  2, a  1, and b  2 in (3). Accuracy to within 0.0001 means that the size of 
the error should be less than 0.0001. Therefore, we choose n so that

on each consecutive pair of intervals we approximate the curve y  f x 0 by a parabola 
as shown in Figure 7. If yi  f xi , then Pi xi, yi  is the point on the curve lying above xi.

SECTION 7.7 APPROXIMATE INTEGRATION .... 523 

To simplify our calculations, we first consider the case where x0  h, x1  0, and 
x2  h. (See Figure 8.) We know that the equation of the parabola through P0, P1, and P2 
is of the form y  Ax2 Bx C and so the area under the parabola from x  h to 
x  h is

But, since the parabola passes through P0h, y0 , P10, y1, and P2h, y2 , we have 
y0  Ah2 Bh C  Ah2 Bh C 
y1  C 
y2  Ah2 Bh C 

and therefore y0 4y1 y2  2Ah2 6C 
Thus, we can rewrite the area under the parabola as 

h 

y0 4y1 y2  

3 

Now, by shifting this parabola horizontally we do not change the area under it. This means 
that the area under the parabola through P0, P1, and P2 from x  x0 to x  x2 in Figure 7 
is still 

h 

y0 4y1 y2 

Similarly, the area under the parabola through P2, P3, and P4 from x  x2 to x  x4 is 
h 

y2 4y3 y4 

Although we have derived this approximation for the case in which f x 0, it is a reasonable 
approximation for any continuous function f and is called Simpson’s Rule after 
the English mathematician Thomas Simpson (1710–1761). Note the pattern of coefficients: 
1, 4, 2, 4, 2, 4, 2, ..., 4, 2, 4, 1.

Notice that, in Example 4, Simpson’s Rule gives us a much better approximation 
to the true value of the integral than does the 
Trapezoidal Rule or the Midpoint Rule . It turns out 
(see Exercise 48) that the approximations in Simpson’s Rule are weighted averages of 
those in the Trapezoidal and Midpoint Rules: 
(Recall that and usually have opposite signs and is about half the size of .) 
In many applications of calculus we need to evaluate an integral even if no explicit for-
mula is known for y as a function of x. A function may be given graphically or as a table 
of values of collected data. If there is evidence that the values are not changing rapidly, 
then the Trapezoidal Rule or Simpson’s Rule can still be used to find an approximate value 
for , the integral of y with respect to x.

In Exercises 27 and 28 you are asked to demonstrate, in particular cases, that the error 
in Simpson’s Rule decreases by a factor of about 16 when n is doubled. That is consistent 
with the appearance of n4 in the denominator of the following error estimate for Simpson’s 
Rule. It is similar to the estimates given in (3) for the Trapezoidal and Midpoint Rules, but 
it uses the fourth derivative of f .

526 .... CHAPTER 7 TECHNIQUES OF INTEGRATION 

|||| Many calculators and computer algebra systems 
have a built-in algorithm that computes an 
approximation of a definite integral. Some of 
these machines use Simpson’s Rule; others use 
more sophisticated techniques such as adaptive 
numerical integration. This means that if a function 
fluctuates much more on a certain part of 
the interval than it does elsewhere, then that 
part gets divided into more subintervals. This 
strategy reduces the number of calculations 
required to achieve a prescribed accuracy. 

|||| Figure 10 illustrates the calculation in 
Example 7. Notice that the parabolic arcs are 
so close to the graph of y  ex 2 that they are 
practically indistinguishable from it.

EXAMPLE 6 How large should we take n in order to guarantee that the Simpson’s Rule

Therefore, we can take K  24 in (4). Thus, for an error less than 0.0001 we should 
choose n so that

Therefore, n  8(n must be even) gives the desired accuracy. (Compare this with

Midpoint Rule.)

|||| 7.8 Improper Integrals 

In defining a definite integral xab f x dx we dealt with a function f defined on a finite interval 
	a, b
 and we assumed that f does not have an infinite discontinuity (see Section 5.2). 
In this section we extend the concept of a definite integral to the case where the interval is 
infinite and also to the case where f has an infinite discontinuity in 	a, b
. In either case 
the integral is called an improper integral. One of the most important applications of this 
idea, probability distributions, will be studied in Section 8.5.

area of the region S is A and we write 

y bfx dx  lim yat

We use this equation to define an improper integral of Type 2 even when f is not a positive 
function, no matter what type of discontinuity f has at b.

Definition of an Improper Integral of Type 2 
(a) If f is continuous on a, b and is discontinuous at b, then 
y bfx dx  lim y tfx dx

if this limit exists (as a finite number). 

(b) If f is continuous on a, b and is discontinuous at a, then 
y bfx dx  lim y bfx dx 

at l a t 

if this limit exists (as a finite number). 

The improper integral xab fx dx is called convergent if the corresponding limit 
exists and divergent if the limit does not exist. 

(c) If f has a discontinuity at c, where a  c  b, and both xac fx dx and

Sometimes it is impossible to find the exact value of an improper integral and yet it 
is important to know whether it is convergent or divergent. In such cases the following theorem 
is useful. Although we state it for Type 1 integrals, a similar theorem is true for 
Type 2 integrals. 

Comparison Theorem Suppose that f and t are continuous functions with 

fx  tx  0 for x  a.

(b) If xa 
 tx dx is divergent, then xa 
 fx dx is divergent. 
We omit the proof of the Comparison Theorem, but Figure 12 makes it seem plausible. 
If the area under the top curve y  fx is finite, then so is the area under the bottom curve 
y  tx. And if the area under y  tx is infinite, then so is the area under y  fx. 
[Note that the reverse is not necessarily true: If xa 
 tx dx is convergent, xa 
 fx dx may 
or may not be convergent, and if xa 
 fx dx is divergent, xa 
 tx dx may or may not be 

FIGURE 12 divergent.] 

EXAMPLE 9 Show that y0

SOLUTION 

(a) At first sight, the given equation may appear somewhat baffling. How is it possible 
|||| The principles of problem solving are to connect the left side to the right side? Connections can often be made through one of 
discussed on page 80. the principles of problem solving: introduce something extra. Here the extra ingredient is 
a new variable. We often think of introducing a new variable when we use the Substitution 
Rule to integrate a specific function. But that technique is still useful in the present 
circumstance in which we have a general function f . 

Once we think of making a substitution, the form of the right side suggests that it 
should be u  a  x. Then du  dx. When x  0, u  a; when x  a, u  0. So 

a

y f a  x dx  y f u du  y f u du

But this integral on the right side is just another way of writing x0 
af x dx. So the given 
equation is proved.

We looked at some applications of integrals in Chapter 6: 
areas, volumes, work, and average values. Here we 
explore some of the many other geometric applications of 

integration—the length of a curve, the area of a surface— 
as well as quantities of interest in physics, engineering, 
biology, economics, and statistics. For instance, we will investigate the center of 
gravity of a plate, the force exerted by water pressure on a dam, the flow of blood 
from the human heart, and the average time spent on hold during a telephone call. 


|||| 8.1 Arc Length 


What do we mean by the length of a curve? We might think of fitting a piece of string to 
the curve in Figure 1 and then measuring the string against a ruler. But that might be 
difficult to do with much accuracy if we have a complicated curve. We need a precise 
definition for the length of an arc of a curve, in the same spirit as the definitions we devel-

FIGURE 1 oped for the concepts of area and volume. 
If the curve is a polygon, we can easily find its length; we just add the lengths of the 
line segments that form the polygon. (We can use the distance formula to find the distance 
between the endpoints of each segment.) We are going to define the length of a general 
curve by first approximating it by a polygon and then taking a limit as the number of segments 
of the polygon is increased. This process is familiar for the case of a circle, where 
the circumference is the limit of lengths of inscribed polygons (see Figure 2). 
Now suppose that a curve C is defined by the equation y  f x, where f is continuous 
and a  x  b. We obtain a polygonal approximation to C by dividing the interval a,b 
into n subintervals with endpoints x0,x1,...,xn and equal width x. If yi  f xi , then 
the point Pi xi,yi  lies on C and the polygon with vertices P0, P1,..., Pn, illustrated in 
Figure 3, is an approximation to C. The length L of C is approximately the length of this 
polygon and the approximation gets better as we let n increase. (See Figure 4, where the 
arc of the curve between Pi1 and Pi has been magnified and approximations with succes-
FIGURE 2 sively smaller values of x are shown.) Therefore, we define the length L of the curve C

Notice that the procedure for defining arc length is very similar to the procedure we 
used for defining area and volume: We divided the curve into a large number of small parts. 
We then found the approximate lengths of the small parts and added them. Finally, we took 
the limit as n l . 

The definition of arc length given by Equation 1 is not very convenient for computational 
purposes, but we can derive an integral formula for L in the case where f has a 
continuous derivative. [Such a function f is called smooth because a small change in x 
produces a small change in fx.]

By applying the Mean Value Theorem to f on the interval xi1, xi , we find that there is a 
number xi * between xi1 and xi such that 

fxi   fxi1   fxi *xi  xi1 

SECTION 8.1 ARC LENGTH .... 551 

The Arc Length Function 

We will find it useful to have a function that measures the arc length of a curve from a particular 
starting point to any other point on the curve. Thus, if a smooth curve C has the 
equation y  f x, a  x  b, let sx be the distance along C from the initial point 
P0a, f a to the point Qx, f x. Then s is a function, called the arc length function, and, 
by Formula 2,

|||| 8.2 Area of a Surface of Revolution 

A surface of revolution is formed when a curve is rotated about a line. Such a surface is 
the lateral boundary of a solid of revolution of the type discussed in Sections 6.2 and 6.3. 
We want to define the area of a surface of revolution in such a way that it corresponds 

to our intuition. If the surface area is A, we can imagine that painting the surface would 

require the same amount of paint as does a flat region with area A. 

Let’s start with some simple surfaces. The lateral surface area of a circular cylinder with 

r 
cut 
A  2rh

radius and height is taken to be 

h 

because we can imagine cutting the cylin


r 

2r 

and h

.


der and unrolling it (as in Figure 1) to obtain a rectangle with dimensions

h 

Likewise, we can take a circular cone with base radius r and slant height l , cut it along 
the dashed line in Figure 2, and flatten it to form a sector of a circle with radius l and cen


tral angle 

 2rl

. We know that, in general, the area of a sector of a circle with radius 

h 
is 

1 

2 l 2

l 

and angle 

(see Exercise 35 in Section 7.3) and so in this case it is

What about more complicated surfaces of revolution? If we follow the strategy we used 
with arc length, we can approximate the original curve by a polygon. When this polygon 
is rotated about an axis, it creates a simpler surface whose surface area approximates the 
actual surface area. By taking a limit, we can determine the exact surface area. 

The approximating surface, then, consists of a number of bands, each formed by rotating 
a line segment about an axis. To find the surface area, each of these bands can be 
considered a portion of a circular cone, as shown in Figure 3. The area of the band (or frustum 
of a cone) with slant height l and upper and lower radii r1 and r2 is found by subtracting 
the areas of two cones:

which is obtained by rotating the curve y  f x, a  x  b, about the x-axis, where f is

positive and has a continuous derivative. In order to define its surface area, we divide the 
interval a, b into n subintervals with endpoints x0, x1,..., xn and equal width x, as we 
did in determining arc length. If yi  f xi , then the point Pixi, yi  lies on the curve. The 
part of the surface between xi1 and xi is approximated by taking the line segment Pi1Pi 
and rotating it about the x-axis. The result is a band with slant height l   Pi1Pi  and average 
radius r  21 yi1  yi  so, by Formula 2, its surface area is

|||| 8.3 Applications to Physics and Engineering 

Among the many applications of integral calculus to physics and engineering, we consider 
two here: force due to water pressure and centers of mass. As with our previous applications 
to geometry (areas, volumes, and lengths) and to work, our strategy is to break up the 
physical quantity into a large number of small parts, approximate each small part, add the 
results, take the limit, and then evaluate the resulting integral. 

Hydrostatic Pressure and Force 

surface of fluid Deep-sea divers realize that water pressure increases as they dive deeper. This is because 
the weight of the water above them increases. 
In general, suppose that a thin horizontal plate with area A square meters is submerged 

d 
A 
in a fluid of density 

kilograms per cubic meter at a depth d meters below the surface of 

the fluid as in Figure 1. The fluid directly above the plate has volume V  Ad, so its mass 

is 

m  

V . 


Ad

. The force exerted by the fluid on the plate is therefore 

FIGURE 1

where t is the acceleration due to gravity. The pressure P on the plate is defined to be the 
force per unit area:

, where 

t

(abbreviation: 1 Nm

An important principle of fluid pressure is the experimentally verified fact that at any 
point in a liquid the pressure is the same in all directions. (A diver feels the same pressure 
on nose and both ears.) Thus, the pressure in any direction at a depth d in a fluid with mass 

density 

is given by

This helps us determine the hydrostatic force against a vertical plate or wall or dam in a 
fluid. This is not a straightforward problem because the pressure is not constant but 
increases as the depth increases. 

EXAMPLE 1 A dam has the shape of the trapezoid shown in Figure 2. The height is 20 m, 
and the width is 50 m at the top and 30 m at the bottom. Find the force on the dam 

due to hydrostatic pressure if the water level is 4 m from the top of the dam. 

SOLUTION We choose a vertical x-axis with origin at the surface of the water as in 
Figure 3(a). The depth of the water is 16 m, so we divide the interval 0, 16 into sub


50 m

EXAMPLE 2 Find the hydrostatic force on one end of a cylindrical drum with radius 3 ft if 
the drum is submerged in water 10 ft deep. 

SOLUTION In this example it is convenient to choose the axes as in Figure 4 so that the 
origin is placed at the center of the drum. Then the circle has a simple equation, 
x2  y2  9. As in Example 1 we divide the circular region into horizontal strips of 
equal width. From the equation of the circle, we see that the length of the ith strip is 
2s9  yi *2 and so its area is

Moments and Centers of Mass 
Our main objective here is to find the point on which a thin plate of any given shape bal-P 
ances horizontally as in Figure 5. This point is called the center of mass (or center of gravity) 
of the plate. 
We first consider the simpler situation illustrated in Figure 6, where two masses m1 and 
m2 are attached to a rod of negligible mass on opposite sides of a fulcrum and at distances 
d1 and d2 from the fulcrum. The rod will balance if 
FIGURE 5 2 m1d1  m2d2 
d¡ d™ This is an experimental fact discovered by Archimedes and called the Law of the Lever. 
(Think of a lighter person balancing a heavier one on a seesaw by sitting farther away from 
the center.) 
Now suppose that the rod lies along the -axis withx m1 at x1 and m2 at x2 and the center 
of mass at . If we compare Figures 6 and 7, we see that andd1  x  x1x d2  x2  x and 
so Equation 2 gives

In general, if we have a system of n particles with masses m1, m2, ..., mn located at the

Now we consider a system of n particles with masses m1, m2, ..., mn located at the 
points x1, y1, x2, y2 ,..., xn, yn  in the xy-plane as shown in Figure 8. By analogy with 
the one-dimensional case, we define the moment of the system about the y-axis to be

and the moment of the system about the x-axis as

Then My measures the tendency of the system to rotate about the y-axis and Mx measures 
the tendency to rotate about the x-axis. 

As in the one-dimensional case, the coordinates x, y of the center of mass are given 
in terms of the moments by the formulas

where m   mi is the total mass. Since mx  My and my  Mx, the center of mass 
x, y is the point where a single particle of mass m would have the same moments as the 
system. 

EXAMPLE 3 Find the moments and center of mass of the system of objects that have 
masses 3, 4, and 8 at the points 1, 1, 2, 1, and 3, 2.

Mx  31  41  82  15

m 15 m 15 

(114

FIGURE 9 Thus, the center of mass is 15, 1). (See Figure 9.) 


Next we consider a flat plate (called a lamina) with uniform density 

that occupies a 

region  of the plane. We wish to locate the center of mass of the plate, which is called 
the centroid of . In doing so we use the following physical principles: The symmetry 
principle says that if  is symmetric about a line l , then the centroid of  lies on l . (If  
is reflected about l, then  remains the same so its centroid remains fixed. But the only 
fixed points lie on .) Thus, the centroid of a rectangle is its center. Moments should be 

l 
defined so that if the entire mass of a region is concentrated at the center of mass, then its 
moments remain unchanged. Also, the moment of the union of two nonoverlapping regions 
should be the sum of the moments of the individual regions.

Suppose that the region  is of the type shown in Figure 10(a); that is,  lies between 

the lines x  a and x  b, above the x-axis, and beneath the graph of f , where f is a 

continuous function. We divide the interval a, b into n subintervals with endpoints

x0, x1, ..., xn and equal width x. We choose the sample point xi * to be the midpoint xi of 
the ith subinterval, that is, xi  xi1  xi 2. This determines the polygonal approximation 
to  shown in Figure 10(b). The centroid of the ith approximating rectangle Ri is its 
center Ci(xi, 21 f xi ). Its area is f xi  x, so its mass is

Just as for systems of particles, the center of mass of the plate is defined so that

In this section we consider some applications of integration to economics (consumer surplus) 
and biology (blood flow, cardiac output). Others are described in the exercises. 

Consumer Surplus 

Recall from Section 4.8 that the demand function px is the price that a company has to 
charge in order to sell x units of a commodity. Usually, selling larger quantities requires 
lowering prices, so the demand function is a decreasing function. The graph of a typical 
demand function, called a demand curve, is shown in Figure 1. If X is the amount of the 
commodity that is currently available, then P  pX is the current selling price. 

We divide the interval 0, X into n subintervals, each of length x  Xn, and let 
xi *  xi be the right endpoint of the ith subinterval, as in Figure 2. If, after the first xi1 
units were sold, a total of only xi units had been available and the price per unit had been 
set at pxi dollars, then the additional x units could have been sold (but no more). The 
consumers who would have paid pxi dollars placed a high value on the product; they 
would have paid what it was worth to them. So, in paying only P dollars they have saved 
an amount of 

savings per unitnumber of units  pxi   P x 

Considering similar groups of willing consumers for each of the subintervals and adding 
the savings, we get the total savings:

The consumer surplus represents the amount of money saved by consumers in purchasing 
the commodity at price P, corresponding to an amount demanded of X. Figure 3

shows the interpretation of the consumer surplus as the area under the demand curve and 
consumer above the line p  P.

Blood Flow 

In Example 7 in Section 3.3 we discussed the law of laminar flow: 

P 

R2  r2 

vr  

4l 

which gives the velocity v of blood that flows along a blood vessel with radius R and length 
l at a distance r from the central axis, where P is the pressure difference between the ends 

of the vessel and 

is the viscosity of the blood. Now, in order to compute the rate of blood 

flow, or flux (volume per unit time), we consider smaller, equally spaced radii r1, r2, .... 
The approximate area of the ring (or washer) with inner radius ri1 and outer radius ri is 

2ri r 

where r  ri  ri1

ri 
(See Figure 4.) If r is small, then the velocity is almost constant throughout this ring and 
can be approximated by vri . Thus, the volume of blood per unit time that flows across the 

Îr 

ring is approximately 

2ri rvri   2

rivri  r 

and the total volume of blood that flows across a cross-section per unit time is approximately 


n 

2rivri  r 

FIGURE 4 

i1


This approximation is illustrated in Figure 5. Notice that the velocity (and hence the volume 
per unit time) increases toward the center of the blood vessel. The approximation gets 
better as n increases. When we take the limit we get the exact value of the flux (or discharge), 
which is the volume of blood that passes a cross-section per unit time: 
The resulting equation 
is called Poiseuille’s Law; it shows that the flux is proportional to the fourth power of the 
radius of the blood vessel. 
Cardiac Output 
Figure 6 shows the human cardiovascular system. Blood returns from the body through the 
veins, enters the right atrium of the heart, and is pumped to the lungs through the pulmonary 
arteries for oxygenation. It then flows back into the left atrium through the pulmonary 
veins and then out to the rest of the body through the aorta. The cardiac output of 
the heart is the volume of blood pumped by the heart per unit time, that is, the rate of flow 
into the aorta. 
The dye dilution method is used to measure the cardiac output. Dye is injected into the 
right atrium and flows through the heart into the aorta. A probe inserted into the aorta measures 
the concentration of the dye leaving the heart at equally spaced times over a time 
interval until the dye has cleared. Let be the concentration of the dye at time 
If we divide into subintervals of equal length , then the amount of dye that flows 
past the measuring point during the subinterval from to is approximately 
where is the rate of flow that we are trying to determine. Thus, the total amount of dye 
is approximately 
and, letting ,we find that the amount of dye is

High blood pressure results from constriction of the arteries. 
To maintain a normal flow rate (flux), the heart has to pump 
harder, thus increasing the blood pressure. Use Poiseuille’s 
Law to show that if R0 and P0 are normal values of the radius 
and pressure in an artery and the constricted values are R and

Calculus plays a role in the analysis of random behavior. Suppose we consider the cholesterol 
level of a person chosen at random from a certain age group, or the height of an adult 
female chosen at random, or the lifetime of a randomly chosen battery of a certain type. 
Such quantities are called continuous random variables because their values actually 
range over an interval of real numbers, although they might be measured or recorded only 
to the nearest integer. We might want to know the probability that a blood cholesterol level 
is greater than 250, or the probability that the height of an adult female is between 60 and 
70 inches, or the probability that the battery we are buying lasts between 100 and 200 
hours. If X represents the lifetime of that type of battery, we denote this last probability as 
follows: 

P100  X  200 

According to the frequency interpretation of probability, this number is the long-run proportion 
of all batteries of the specified type whose lifetimes are between 100 and 200 
hours. Since it represents a proportion, the probability naturally falls between 0 and 1. 


576 .... CHAPTER 8 FURTHER APPLICATIONS OF INTEGRATION 

Every continuous random variable X has a probability density function f. This means 
that the probability that X lies between a and b is found by integrating f from a to b:

For example, Figure 1 shows the graph of a model of the probability density function f 
for a random variable X defined to be the height in inches of an adult female in the United 
States (according to data from the National Health Survey). The probability that the height 
of a woman chosen at random from this population is between 60 and 70 inches is equal 
to the area under the graph of f from 60 to 70.

(a) For 0  x  10 we have 0.006x10  x  0, so fx  0 for all x. We also need to

SOLUTION Think of the random variable as being the time you wait on hold before an 
agent of a company you’re telephoning answers your call. So instead of x, let’s use t to 
represent time, in minutes. If f is the probability density function and you call at time 
t  0, then, from Definition 1, x02 f t dt represents the probability that an agent answers 
within the first two minutes and x45 f t dt is the probability that your call is answered 
during the fifth minute. 

It’s clear that f t  0 for t  0 (the agent can’t answer before you place the call). 
For t 	 0 we are told to use an exponentially decreasing function, that is, a function of 
the form f t  Aect, where A and c are positive constants. Thus 

if t  0 

f t  0

Suppose you’re waiting for a company to answer your phone call and you wonder how 
long, on average, you can expect to wait. Let f t be the corresponding density function, 
where t is measured in minutes, and think of a sample of N people who have called this 
company. Most likely, none of them had to wait more than an hour, so let’s restrict our 
attention to the interval 0  t  60. Let’s divide that interval into n intervals of length t 
and endpoints 0, t1, t2, .... (Think of t as lasting a minute, or half a minute, or 10 seconds, 
or even a second.) The probability that somebody’s call gets answered during the 
time period from ti1 to ti is the area under the curve y  f t from ti1 to ti , which is 
approximately equal to f ti  t. (This is the area of the approximating rectangle in Figure 
3, where ti is the midpoint of the interval.) 

FIGURE 3 Since the long-run proportion of calls that get answered in the time period from ti1 to 
ti is f ti  t, we expect that, out of our sample of N callers, the number whose call was 
answered in that time period is approximately Nf ti  t and the time that each waited is 
about ti. Therefore, the total time they waited is the product of these numbers: approximately 
ti Nf ti  t. Adding over all such intervals, we get the approximate total of everybody’s 
waiting times:

(a) Find the probability that a call is answered during the first minute. 
(b) Find the probability that a customer waits more than five minutes to be answered.

(a) We are given that the mean of the exponential distribution is

About 37% of customers wait more than five minutes before their calls are answered. 


Notice the result of Example 4(b): Even though the mean waiting time is 5 minutes, 
only 37% of callers wait more than 5 minutes. The reason is that some callers have to wait 
much longer (maybe 10 or 15 minutes), and this brings up the average. 

Another measure of centrality of a probability density function is the median. That is a 
number m such that half the callers have a waiting time less than m and the other callers 
have a waiting time longer than m. In general, the median of a probability density function 
is the number m such that 

y  f x dx  1 

2 

m 

This means that half the area under the graph of f lies to the right of m. In Exercise 7 you 
are asked to show that the median waiting time for the company described in Example 4 
is approximately 3.5 minutes.

capability of a calculator or computer (or the Midpoint Rule or Simpson’s Rule) to estimate 
the integral. Doing so, we find that 

P85  X  115 0.68 

So about 68% of the population has an IQ between 85 and 115, that is, within one standard

In a famous 18th-century problem, known as Buffon’s needle problem, a needle of length h is

intersecting one of the lines. Assume that the lines run east-west, parallel to the x-axis in a 
rectangular coordinate system (as in the figure). Let y be the distance from the “southern” end 
of the needle to the nearest line to the north. (If the needle’s southern end lies on a line, let 
y  0. If the needle happens to lie east-west, let the “western” end be the “southern” end.) Let

Differential Equations 



Perhaps the most important of all the applications of calculus 
is to differential equations. When physical scientists 
or social scientists use calculus, more often than not it is to 

analyze a differential equation that has arisen in the process 
of modeling some phenomenon that they are studying. 
Although it is often impossible to find an explicit formula for the solution of a differential 
equation, we will see that graphical and numerical approaches provide the 
needed information. 

|||| 9.1 Modeling with Differential Equations 

|||| Now is a good time to read (or reread) the 
In describing the process of modeling in Section 1.2, we talked about formulating a math


discussion of mathematical modeling on page 25. 
ematical model of a real-world problem either through intuitive reasoning about the phenomenon 
or from a physical law based on evidence from experiments. The mathematical 
model often takes the form of a differential equation, that is, an equation that contains an 
unknown function and some of its derivatives. This is not surprising because in a realworld 
problem we often notice that changes occur and we want to predict future behavior 
on the basis of how current values change. Let’s begin by examining several examples of 
how differential equations arise when we model physical phenomena. 

Models of Population Growth 

One model for the growth of a population is based on the assumption that the population 
grows at a rate proportional to the size of the population. That is a reasonable assumption 
for a population of bacteria or animals under ideal conditions (unlimited environment, 
adequate nutrition, absence of predators, immunity from disease). 

Let’s identify and name the variables in this model: 

t  time the independent variable 

P  the number of individuals in the population the dependent variable 

The rate of growth of the population is the derivative dPdt. So our assumption that the 
rate of growth of the population is proportional to the population size is written as the 
equation 

1
dP 

 kP 

dt 

where k is the proportionality constant. Equation 1 is our first model for population 
growth; it is a differential equation because it contains an unknown function P and its 
derivative dPdt. 

Having formulated a model, let’s look at its consequences. If we rule out a population 
of 0, then Pt  0 for all t. So, if k  0, then Equation 1 shows that Pt  0 for all t. 
This means that the population is always increasing. In fact, as Pt increases, Equation 1 
shows that dPdt becomes larger. In other words, the growth rate increases as the population 
increases.

Solutions of the logistic equation 

Let’s try to think of a solution of Equation 1. This equation asks us to find a function 
whose derivative is a constant multiple of itself. We know that exponential functions have 
that property. In fact, if we let , then 

Pt  Cekt 

Pt  Ckekt   kCekt   kPt 

Thus, any exponential function of the form Pt  Cekt is a solution of Equation 1. When 
we study this equation in detail in Section 9.4, we will see that there is no other solution. 

Allowing C to vary through all the real numbers, we get the family of solutions 
Pt  Cekt 

whose graphs are shown in Figure 1. But populations have only positive 
values and so we are interested only in the solutions with C  0. And we are probably concerned 
only with values of t greater than the initial time t  0. Figure 2 shows the physically 
meaningful solutions. Putting t  0, we get P0  Cek0  C, so the constant C 
turns out to be the initial population, P0. 

Equation 1 is appropriate for modeling population growth under ideal conditions, but 
we have to recognize that a more realistic model must reflect the fact that a given environment 
has limited resources. Many populations start by increasing in an exponential 
manner, but the population levels off when it approaches its carrying capacity K (or 
decreases toward K if it ever exceeds K). For a model to take into account both trends, we 
make two assumptions: 

dP 

 

 kP if P is small (Initially, the growth rate is proportional to P.)
dt 

dP 

 

 0 if P  K (P decreases if it ever exceeds K.)

dt 

A simple expression that incorporates both assumptions is given by the equation 

2 
dP P 

 kP1  

dt K 

Notice that if P is small compared with K, then PK is close to 0 and so dPdt  kP. If 
P  K, then 1  PK is negative and so dPdt  0. 

Equation 2 is called the logistic differential equation and was proposed by the Dutch 
mathematical biologist Pierre-François Verhulst in the 1840s as a model for world population 
growth. We will develop techniques that enable us to find explicit solutions of the 
logistic equation in Section 9.5, but for now we can deduce qualitative characteristics of 
the solutions directly from Equation 2. We first observe that the constant functions 
Pt  0 and Pt  K are solutions because, in either case, one of the factors on the right 
side of Equation 2 is zero. (This certainly makes physical sense: If the population is ever 
either 0 or at the carrying capacity, it stays that way.) These two constant solutions are 
called equilibrium solutions. 

If the initial population P0 lies between 0 and K, then the right side of Equation 2 is 
positive, so dPdt  0 and the population increases. But if the population exceeds the carrying 
capacity P  K, then 1  PK is negative, so dPdt  0 and the population 
decreases. Notice that, in either case, if the population approaches the carrying capacity 
P l K, then dPdt l 0, which means the population levels off. So we expect that the 
solutions of the logistic differential equation have graphs that look something like the ones 
in Figure 3. Notice that the graphs move away from the equilibrium solution P  0 and 
move toward the equilibrium solution P  K.

A Model for the Motion of a Spring 

Let’s now look at an example of a model from the physical sciences. We consider the 
motion of an object with mass m at the end of a vertical spring (as in Figure 4). In Section 
6.4 we discussed Hooke’s Law, which says that if the spring is stretched (or compressed) 
x units from its natural length, then it exerts a force that is proportional to x: 

restoring force  kx 

where k is a positive constant (called the spring constant). If we ignore any external resisting 
forces (due to air resistance or friction) then, by Newton’s Second Law (force equals 
mass times acceleration), we have 

3 
d2x 

m  kx 

dt2 

This is an example of what is called a second-order differential equation because it 
involves second derivatives. Let’s see what we can guess about the form of the solution 
directly from the equation. We can rewrite Equation 3 in the form 

d2xk 

  x 

dt2 m 

which says that the second derivative of x is proportional to x but has the opposite sign. We 
know two functions with this property, the sine and cosine functions. In fact, it turns 
out that all solutions of Equation 3 can be written as combinations of certain sine 
and cosine functions (see Exercise 3). This is not surprising; we expect the spring to oscillate 
about its equilibrium position and so it is natural to think that trigonometric functions 
are involved. 

General Differential Equations 

In general, a differential equation is an equation that contains an unknown function and 
one or more of its derivatives. The order of a differential equation is the order of the highest 
derivative that occurs in the equation. Thus, Equations 1 and 2 are first-order equations 
and Equation 3 is a second-order equation. In all three of those equations the independent 
variable is called t and represents time, but in general the independent variable doesn’t 
have to represent time. For example, when we consider the differential equation 

4

it is understood that y is an unknown function of x. 

A function f is called a solution of a differential equation if the equation is satisfied 
when y  f x and its derivatives are substituted into the equation. Thus, f is a solution of 
Equation 4 if

When we are asked to solve a differential equation we are expected to find all possible 
solutions of the equation. We have already solved some particularly simple differential

When applying differential equations, we are usually not as interested in finding a family 
of solutions (the general solution) as we are in finding a solution that satisfies some 
additional requirement. In many physical problems we need to find the particular solution 
that satisfies a condition of the form yt0   y0. This is called an initial condition, and the 
problem of finding a solution of the differential equation that satisfies the initial condition 
is called an initial-value problem. 

Geometrically, when we impose an initial condition, we look at the family of solution 
curves and pick the one that passes through the point t0, y0 . Physically, this corresponds 
to measuring the state of a system at time t0 and using the solution of the initial-value problem 
to predict the future behavior of the system.

Unfortunately, it’s impossible to solve most differential equations in the sense of obtaining 
an explicit formula for the solution. In this section we show that, despite the absence 
of an explicit solution, we can still learn a lot about the solution through a graphical 
approach (direction fields) or a numerical approach (Euler’s method). 

Direction Fields 

Suppose we are asked to sketch the graph of the solution of the initial-value problem 

y  x  yy0  1 

We don’t know a formula for the solution, so how can we possibly sketch its graph? Let’s 
think about what the differential equation means. The equation y  x  y tells us that the 
slope at any point x, y on the graph (called the solution curve) is equal to the sum of the 


SECTION 9.2 DIRECTION FIELDS AND EULER’S METHOD .... 593 

x- and y-coordinates of the point (see Figure 1). In particular, because the curve passes 
through the point 0, 1, its slope there must be 0  1  1. So a small portion of the solution 
curve near the point 0, 1 looks like a short line segment through 0, 1 with slope 1 
(see Figure 2).

As a guide to sketching the rest of the curve, let’s draw short line segments at a number 
of points x, y with slope x  y. The result is called a direction field and is shown in 
Figure 3. For instance, the line segment at the point 1, 2 has slope 1  2  3. The direction 
field allows us to visualize the general shape of the solution curves by indicating the 
direction in which the curves proceed at each point.

Direction field for yª=x+y The solution curve through (0, 1) 

Now we can sketch the solution curve through the point 0, 1 by following the direction 
field as in Figure 4. Notice that we have drawn the curve so that it is parallel to nearby 
line segments. 

In general, suppose we have a first-order differential equation of the form 

y  Fx, y 

where Fx, y is some expression in x and y. The differential equation says that the slope 
of a solution curve at a point x, y on the curve is Fx, y. If we draw short line segments 
with slope Fx, y at several points x, y, the result is called a direction field (or slope 
field). These line segments indicate the direction in which a solution curve is heading, so 
the direction field helps us visualize the general shape of these curves.

Now we draw short line segments with these slopes at these points. The result is the 
direction field shown in Figure 5. 

(b) We start at the origin and move to the right in the direction of the line segment 
(which has slope 1). We continue to draw the solution curve so that it moves parallel 
to the nearby line segments. The resulting solution curve is shown in Figure 6. Returning 
to the origin, we draw the solution curve to the left as well. 
The more line segments we draw in a direction field, the clearer the picture becomes. 
Of course, it’s tedious to compute slopes and draw line segments for a huge number of 
points by hand, but computers are well suited for this task. Figure 7 shows a more detailed, 
computer-drawn direction field for the differential equation in Example 1. It enables us to 
draw, with reasonable accuracy, the solution curves shown in Figure 8 with y-intercepts

Now let’s see how direction fields give insight into physical situations. The simple electric 
circuit shown in Figure 9 contains an electromotive force (usually a battery or generator) 
that produces a voltage of Et volts (V) and a current of It amperes (A) at time t. 
The circuit also contains a resistor with a resistance of R ohms () and an inductor with 
an inductance of L henries (H). 

Ohm’s Law gives the drop in voltage due to the resistor as RI. The voltage drop due to 
the inductor is LdIdt. One of Kirchhoff’s laws says that the sum of the voltage drops is 
equal to the supplied voltage Et. Thus, we have

L  RI  Et

which is a first-order differential equation that models the current I at time t .

Notice from Figure 10 that the line segments along any horizontal line are parallel. That 
is because the independent variable t does not occur on the right side of the equation 
I  15  3I. In general, a differential equation of the form 

y  f y 

in which the independent variable is missing from the right side, is called autonomous. 
For such an equation, the slopes corresponding to two different points with the same 
y-coordinate must be equal. This means that if we know one solution to an autonomous 
differential equation, then we can obtain infinitely many others just by shifting the graph 
of the known solution to the right or left. In Figure 11 we have shown the solutions 
that result from shifting the solution curve of Example 2 one and two time units (namely, 
seconds) to the right. They correspond to closing the switch when t  1 or t  2. 

Euler’s Method 

The basic idea behind direction fields can be used to find numerical approximations to 
solutions of differential equations. We illustrate the method on the initial-value problem 
that we used to introduce direction fields: 

y  x  yy0 1 

The differential equation tells us that y0 0  1  1, so the solution curve has slope 
1 at the point 0, 1. As a first approximation to the solution we could use the linear approximation 
Lx x  1. In other words, we could use the tangent line at 0, 1as a rough 
approximation to the solution curve (see Figure 12). 

Euler’s idea was to improve on this approximation by proceeding only a short distance 
along this tangent line and then making a midcourse correction by changing direction as 
indicated by the direction field. Figure 13 shows what happens if we start out along the 

tangent line but stop when x  0.5. (This horizontal distance traveled is called the step 
size.) Since L0.5 1.5, we have y0.51.5 and we take 0.5, 1.5as the starting point 
for a new line segment. The differential equation tells us that y0.5 0.5  1.5  2, so 
we use the linear function 

y  1.5  2x  0.5 2x  0.5 

as an approximation to the solution for x  0.5 (the orange segment in Figure 13). If we 
decrease the step size from 0.5 to 0.25, we get the better Euler approximation shown in 
Figure 14.

In general, Euler’s method says to start at the point given by the initial value and proceed 
in the direction indicated by the direction field. Stop after a short time, look at the 
slope at the new location, and proceed in that direction. Keep stopping and changing direc

Module 9.2B shows how Euler’s method 
works numerically and visually for a 
variety of differential equations and 

step sizes. 

|||| Computer software packages that produce 
numerical approximations to solutions of 
differential equations use methods that are 
refinements of Euler’s method. Although Euler’s 
method is simple and not as accurate, it is the 
basic idea on which the more accurate methods 
are based. 

SECTION 9.2 DIRECTION FIELDS AND EULER’S METHOD .... 597 

tion according to the direction field. Euler’s method does not produce the exact solution to 
an initial-value problem—it gives approximations. But by decreasing the step size (and 
therefore increasing the number of midcourse corrections), we obtain successively better 
approximations to the exact solution. (Compare Figures 12, 13, and 14.) 

For the general first-order initial-value problem y  Fx, y, yx0 y0, our aim is to 
find approximate values for the solution at equally spaced numbers x0, x1  x0  h, 
x2  x1  h,..., whereh is the step size. The differential equation tells us that the slope 
at x0, y0 is y  Fx0, y0 , so Figure 15 shows that the approximate value of the solution 
when x  x1 is 

y1  y0  hFx0, y0  

Similarly, y2  y1  hFx1, y1

EXAMPLE 3 Use Euler’s method with step size 0.1 to construct a table of approximate 
values for the solution of the initial-value problem 

y  x  yy0 1 
SOLUTION We are given that h  0.1, x0  0, y0  1, and Fx, y x  y. So we have 

y1  y0  hFx0, y0  1  0.10  1 1.1

y3  y2  hFx2, y2  1.22  0.10.2  1.22 1.362 

This means that if yxis the exact solution, then y0.31.362.

For a more accurate table of values in Example 3 we could decrease the step size. But

need to program a calculator or computer to carry out these calculations. The following

|||| 9.3 Separable Equations 

We have looked at first-order differential equations from a geometric point of view (direction 
fields) and from a numerical point of view (Euler’s method). What about the symbolic 
point of view? It would be nice to have an explicit formula for a solution of a differential 
equation. Unfortunately, that is not always possible. But in this section we examine a certain 
type of differential equation that can be solved explicitly. 

A separable equation is a first-order differential equation in which the expression for 
dydx can be factored as a function of x times a function of y. In other words, it can be 
written in the form 

dy 

 txfy 

dx 

The name separable comes from the fact that the expression on the right side can be “separated” 
into a function of x and a function of y. Equivalently, if fy  0, we could write 

dy tx 

1 
 

dx hy 

where hy  1fy. To solve this equation we rewrite it in the differential form 

hy dy  tx dx 

|||| The technique for solving separable differen-so that all y’s are on one side of the equation and all x’s are on the other side. Then we intetial 
equations was first used by James Bernoulli 

grate both sides of the equation:

(in 1690) in solving a problem about pendulums 
and by Leibniz (in a letter to Huygens in 1691). 
John Bernoulli explained the general method in a 2 y hy dy  ytx dx 
paper published in 1694. 


Equation 2 defines y implicitly as a function of x. In some cases we may be able to solve 
for y in terms of x. 

We use the Chain Rule to justify this procedure: If h and t satisfy (2), then 

d 
dx y hy dy 
d 
dx y tx dx 
so 
d 
dy y hy dydy 
dx 
 tx 
and hy 
dy 
 tx 

dx 

Thus, Equation 1 is satisfied.

(b) Find the solution of this equation that satisfies the initial condition y0  2.

y y2 dy  y x2 dx

3  13  C

where C is an arbitrary constant. (We could have used a constant C1 on the left side and 
another constant C2 on the right side. But then we could combine these constants by 
writing C  C2  C1.) 

Solving for y, we get 

3

y  sx3  3C 

We could leave the solution like this or we could write it in the form 

3 x3  K

y  s

where K  3C. (Since C is an arbitrary constant, so is K.)

(b) If we put x  0 in the general solution in part (a), we get y0  sK. To satisfy the 
3

initial condition y0  2, we must have sK  2 and so K  8. 
Thus, the solution of the initial-value problem is

y2  sin y  2x3  C 

where C is a constant. Equation 3 gives the general solution implicitly. In this case it’s 
impossible to solve the equation to express y explicitly as a function of x.

yx  0 for some x, it follows from a 
uniqueness theorem for solutions of differential 
equations that yx  0 for all x.

Orthogonal Trajectories 

An orthogonal trajectory of a family of curves is a curve that intersects each curve of the 
family orthogonally, that is, at right angles (see Figure 7). For instance, each member of 
the family y  mx of straight lines through the origin is an orthogonal trajectory of the 
family x2  y2  r2 of concentric circles with center the origin (see Figure 8). We say that 
the two families are orthogonal trajectories of each other.

EXAMPLE 5 Find the orthogonal trajectories of the family of curves x  ky2, where k is 
an arbitrary constant. 

SOLUTION The curves x  ky2 form a family of parabolas whose axis of symmetry is 
the -axis. The first step is to find a single differential equation that is satisfied by all

x

members of the family. If we differentiate x  ky2, we get 

dy dy 1 

1  2ky or  

dx dx 2ky 

This differential equation depends on k, but we need an equation that is valid for all 
values of k simultaneously. To eliminate k we note that, from the equation of the given 
general parabola x  ky2, we have k  xy2 and so the differential equation can be 
written as 

dy 11 

dx 2ky x 

2 2 y 

ydy y 

or  

dx 2x 

This means that the slope of the tangent line at any point x, y on one of the parabolas is 
y  y2x. On an orthogonal trajectory the slope of the tangent line must be the negative 
reciprocal of this slope. Therefore, the orthogonal trajectories must satisfy the differential 
equation 

dy 2x 

dx y 

This differential equation is separable, and we solve it as follows:

where C is an arbitrary positive constant. Thus, the orthogonal trajectories are the family 
of ellipses given by Equation 4 and sketched in Figure 9. 

Orthogonal trajectories occur in various branches of physics. For example, in an electrostatic 
field the lines of force are orthogonal to the lines of constant potential. Also, the 
streamlines in aerodynamics are orthogonal trajectories of the velocity-equipotential 
curves. 

Mixing Problems 

A typical mixing problem involves a tank of fixed capacity filled with a thoroughly mixed 
solution of some substance, such as salt. A solution of a given concentration enters the tank 
at a fixed rate and the mixture, thoroughly stirred, leaves at a fixed rate, which may differ 
from the entering rate. If yt denotes the amount of substance in the tank at time t, then 
yt is the rate at which the substance is being added minus the rate at which it is being 
removed. The mathematical description of this situation often leads to a first-order separable 
differential equation. We can use the same type of reasoning to model a variety of 
phenomena: chemical reactions, discharge of pollutants into a lake, injection of a drug into 
the bloodstream.

EXAMPLE 6 A tank contains 20 kg of salt dissolved in 5000 L of water. Brine that contains 
0.03 kg of salt per liter of water enters the tank at a rate of 25 Lmin. The solution 
is kept thoroughly mixed and drains from the tank at the same rate. How much salt 
remains in the tank after half an hour? 

SOLUTION Let yt be the amount of salt (in kilograms) after t minutes. We are given that 
y0  20 and we want to find y30. We do this by finding a differential equation satisfied 
by yt. Note that dydt is the rate of change of the amount of salt, so

The tank always contains 5000 L of liquid, so the concentration at time t is yt5000

have

How Fast Does a Tank Drain? 

If water (or other liquid) drains from a tank, we expect that the flow will be greatest at first 
(when the water depth is greatest) and will gradually decrease as the water level decreases. But 
we need a more precise mathematical description of how the flow decreases in order to answer 
the kinds of questions that engineers ask: How long does it take for a tank to drain completely? 
How much water should a tank hold in order to guarantee a certain minimum water pressure for 
a sprinkler system? 

Let ht and Vt. 
t

be the height and volume of water in a tank at time . If water leaks through 
a hole with area a at the bottom of the tank, then Torricelli’s Law says that

is often used and the constant k (which depends on the physical properties of the liquid) is 
determined from data concerning the draining of the tank. 

(a) Suppose that a hole is drilled in the side of a cylindrical bottle and the height h of the 
water (above the hole) decreases from 10 cm to 3 cm in 68 seconds. Use Equation 2 to 
find an expression for ht. Evaluate ht for t  10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60. 
(b) Drill a 4-mm hole near the bottom of the cylindrical part of a two-liter plastic soft-drink 
bottle. Attach a strip of masking tape marked in centimeters from 0 to 10, with 0 corresponding 
to the top of the hole. With one finger over the hole, fill the bottle with water 
to the 10-cm mark. Then take your finger off the hole and record the values of ht for 
t  10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 seconds. (You will probably find that it takes 68 seconds for 
the level to decrease to h  3 cm.) Compare your data with the values of ht from 
part (a). How well did the model predict the actual values? 
3. 
In many parts of the world, the water for sprinkler systems in large hotels and hospitals is 
supplied by gravity from cylindrical tanks on or near the roofs of the buildings. Suppose 
such a tank has radius 10 ft and the diameter of the outlet is 2.5 inches. An engineer has to 
guarantee that the water pressure will be at least 2160 lbft2 for a period of 10 minutes. 
(When a fire happens, the electrical system might fail and it could take up to 10 minutes for 
the emergency generator and fire pump to be activated.) What height should the engineer 
specify for the tank in order to make such a guarantee? (Use the fact that the water pressure 
at a depth of d feet is P  62.5d. See Section 8.3.)

Not all water tanks are shaped like cylinders. Suppose a tank has cross-sectional area Ah at

Which Is Faster, Going Up or Coming Down? 

Suppose you throw a ball into the air. Do you think it takes longer to reach its maximum 
height or to fall back to Earth from its maximum height? We will solve the problem in this project 
but, before getting started, think about that situation and make a guess based on your physical 
intuition. 

1. 
A ball with mass m is projected vertically upward from Earth’s surface with a positive initial 
velocity v0. We assume the forces acting on the ball are the force of gravity and a retarding 
force of air resistance with direction opposite to the direction of motion and with magnitude 
, where p is a positive constant and vt. 
t

p vt. 
is the velocity of the ball at time . In both


|||| In modeling force due to air resistance, 
various functions have been used, depending 
on the physical characteristics and speed of 
the ball. Here we use a linear model, pv, 
but a quadratic model (pv 2 on the way up 
and pv 2 on the way down) is another possibility 
for higher speeds (see Exercise 42 in 
Section 9.3). For a golf ball, experiments 
have shown that a good model is pv 1.3 

1.3

going up and p v coming down. But no 
matter which force function f v is used 
[where f v 	 0 for v 	 0 and f v  0 
for v  0], the answer to the question 
remains the same. See F. Brauer, “What 
Goes Up Must Come Down, Eventually,”

pp. 437–440.

the ascent and the descent, the total force acting on the ball is pv  mt. [During ascent, 
vt is positive and the resistance acts downward; during descent, vt is negative and the 
resistance acts upward.] So, by Newton’s Second Law, the equation of motion is

estimate t2 by using a graph of the height function yt. Which is faster, going up or coming

5. 
In general, it’s not easy to find t2 because it’s impossible to solve the equation yt  0 
explicitly. We can, however, use an indirect method to determine whether ascent or descent 
is faster; we determine whether y2t1 is positive or negative. Show that

9.4 Exponential Growth and Decay 

One of the models for population growth that we considered in Section 9.1 was based 
on the assumption that the population grows at a rate proportional to the size of the 
population: 

dP 

 kP 

dt 

Is that a reasonable assumption? Suppose we have a population (of bacteria, for instance) 


612 .... CHAPTER 9 DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS 

with size P  1000 and at a certain time it is growing at a rate of P  300 bacteria per 
hour. Now let’s take another 1000 bacteria of the same type and put them with the first 
population. Each half of the new population was growing at a rate of 300 bacteria per hour. 
We would expect the total population of 2000 to increase at a rate of 600 bacteria per 
hour initially (provided there’s enough room and nutrition). So if we double the size, we 
double the growth rate. In general, it seems reasonable that the growth rate should be proportional 
to the size. 

The same assumption applies in other situations as well. In nuclear physics, the mass 
of a radioactive substance decays at a rate proportional to the mass. In chemistry, the rate 
of a unimolecular first-order reaction is proportional to the concentration of the substance. 
In finance, the value of a savings account with continuously compounded interest increases 
at a rate proportional to that value. 

In general, if yt is the value of a quantity y at time t and if the rate of change of y with 
respect to t is proportional to its size yt at any time, then 

1

 ky

where k is a constant. Equation 1 is sometimes called the law of natural growth (if k 	 0) 
or the law of natural decay (if k  0). Because it is a separable differential equation we 
can solve it by the methods of Section 9.3:

where A ( 
eC or 0) is an arbitrary constant. To see the significance of the constant A, 
we observe that 

y0  Aek  0  A 

Therefore, A is the initial value of the function. 

Because Equation 1 occurs so frequently in nature, we summarize what we have just 
proved for future use.

The quantity 

1 dP 

P dt 

is the growth rate divided by the population size; it is called the relative growth rate. 
According to (3), instead of saying “the growth rate is proportional to population size” we 
could say “the relative growth rate is constant.” Then (2) says that a population with constant 
relative growth rate must grow exponentially. Notice that the relative growth rate k 
appears as the coefficient of t in the exponential function y0ekt. For instance, if 

dP 

 0.02P 
dt 

and t is measured in years, then the relative growth rate is k  0.02 and the population 
grows at a rate of 2% per year. If the population at time 0 is P0, then the expression for the 
population is 

0.02t

EXAMPLE 1 Assuming that the growth rate is proportional to population size, use the data 
in Table 1 to model the population of the world in the 20th century. What is the relative 
growth rate? How well does the model fit the data? 

SOLUTION We measure the time t in years and let t  0 in the year 1900. We measure the 
population Pt in millions of people. Then the initial condition is P0  1650. We are 
assuming that the growth rate is proportional to population size, so the initial-value problem 
is 

dP 

 kP P0  1650

From (2) we know that the solution is 

Pt  1650ekt 

One way to estimate the relative growth rate k is to use the fact that the population in 
1910 was 1750 million. Therefore 

P10  1650ek10  1750

Radioactive Decay 

Radioactive substances decay by spontaneously emitting radiation. If mt is the mass 
remaining from an initial mass m0 of the substance after time t, then the relative decay rate 

1 dm 

m dt 

has been found experimentally to be constant. (Since dmdt is negative, the relative decay 
rate is positive.) It follows that 

dm 

 km

where k is a negative constant. In other words, radioactive substances decay at a rate proportional 
to the remaining mass. This means that we can use (2) to show that the mass 
decays exponentially: 

mt  m0ekt 

Physicists express the rate of decay in terms of half-life, the time required for half of 
any given quantity to decay.

EXAMPLE 3 The half-life of radium-226 ( 88 ) is 1590 years. 

226Ra

(a) A sample of radium-226 has a mass of 100 mg. Find a formula for the mass of 88 
that remains after t years. 
(b) Find the mass after 1000 years correct to the nearest milligram. 
(c) When will the mass be reduced to 30 mg? 
SOLUTION 

(a) Let mt be the mass of radium-226 (in milligrams) that remains after t years. Then 
dmdt  km and y0  100, so (2) gives 
mt  m0ekt  100ekt 

In order to determine the value of k, we use the fact that y1590  21 100. Thus

We could use the fact that eto write the expression for mt in the alternative 
form 

mt  100  2t1590 

(b) The mass after 1000 years is

ln 21590t  30 ln 21590t  0.3

As a check on our work in Example 3, we use a graphing device to draw the graph of

t  2800, and this agrees with the answer to part (c). 

Newton’s Law of Cooling 

Newton’s Law of Cooling states that the rate of cooling of an object is proportional to 
the temperature difference between the object and its surroundings, provided that this 
difference is not too large. (This law also applies to warming.) If we let Tt be the temperature 
of the object at time t and Ts be the temperature of the surroundings, then we 
can formulate Newton’s Law of Cooling as a differential equation: 

dT 

 kT  Ts 

dt 

where k is a constant. We could solve this equation as a separable differential equation 
by the method of Section 9.3, but an easier method is to make the change of variable 
yt  Tt  Ts. Because Ts is constant, we have yt  Tt and so the equation 
becomes 

dy 

 ky

dt 

We can then use (2) to find an expression for y, from which we can find T. 

EXAMPLE 4 A bottle of soda pop at room temperature (72F) is placed in a refrigerator 
where the temperature is 44F. After half an hour the soda pop has cooled to 61F. 

(a) What is the temperature of the soda pop after another half hour? 
(b) How long does it take for the soda pop to cool to 50F? 
SOLUTION 

(a) Let Tt be the temperature of the soda after t minutes. The surrounding temperature 
is Ts  44F, so Newton’s Law of Cooling states that 
dT 

 kT  44)

If we let y  T  44, then y0  T0  44  72  44  28, so y is a solution of the

and by (2) we have

Continuously Compounded Interest 

EXAMPLE 5 If $1000 is invested at 6% interest, compounded annually, then after 1 year 
the investment is worth $10001.06  $1060, after 2 years it’s worth 
$10001.06	1.06  $1123.60, and after t years it’s worth $10001.06t. In general, if 
an amount A0 is invested at an interest rate r r  0.06 in this example), then after 
t years it’s worth A01  rt. Usually, however, interest is compounded more frequently, 
say, n times a year. Then in each compounding period the interest rate is rn and there 
are nt compounding periods in t years, so the value of the investment is

SECTION 9.4 EXPONENTIAL GROWTH AND DECAY .... 619 

For instance, after 3 years at 6% interest a $1000 investment will be worth 
$10001.063  $1191.02 with annual compounding 
$10001.036  $1194.05 with semiannual compounding

 $10001.01512  $1195.62 with quarterly compounding

You can see that the interest paid increases as the number of compounding periods n 
increases. If we let n l , then we will be compounding the interest continuously and 
the value of the investment will be

But the limit in this expression is equal to the number e (see Equation 3.8.6). So with 
continuous compounding of interest at interest rate r, the amount after t years is

If we differentiate this equation, we get 

dA

which says that, with continuous compounding of interest, the rate of increase of an 
investment is proportional to its size. 

Returning to the example of $1000 invested for 3 years at 6% interest, we see that 
with continuous compounding of interest the value of the investment will be 

0.063

A3  $1000e

 $1000e0.18  $1197.22 

Notice how close this is to the amount we calculated for daily compounding, $1197.20. 
But the amount is easier to compute if we use continuous compounding.

Scientists can determine the age of ancient objects by a method 
called radiocarbon dating. The bombardment of the upper 
atmosphere by cosmic rays converts nitrogen to a radioactive 
isotope of carbon, 14C, with a half-life of about 5730 years. 
Vegetation absorbs carbon dioxide through the atmosphere and 
animal life assimilates 14C through food chains. When a plant 
or animal dies, it stops replacing its carbon and the amount of 
14C begins to decrease through radioactive decay. Therefore, 
the level of radioactivity must also decay exponentially. A 
parchment fragment was discovered that had about 74% as 
much 14C radioactivity as does plant material on Earth today.

Calculus and Baseball 
In this project we explore three of the many applications of calculus to baseball. The physical 
interactions of the game, especially the collision of ball and bat, are quite complex and their 
models are discussed in detail in a book by Robert Adair, The Physics of Baseball, 3d ed. 
(New York: HarperPerennial, 2002). 
1. It may surprise you to learn that the collision of baseball and bat lasts only about a thousandth 
of a second. Here we calculate the average force on the bat during this collision by

|||| 9.5 The Logistic Equation 


In this section we discuss in detail a model for population growth, the logistic model, that 
is more sophisticated than exponential growth. In doing so we use all the tools at our disposal—
direction fields and Euler’s method from Section 9.2 and the explicit solution of 
separable differential equations from Section 9.3. In the exercises we investigate other possible 
models for population growth, some of which take into account harvesting and seasonal 
growth. 

The Logistic Model 

As we discussed in Section 9.1, a population often increases exponentially in its early 
stages but levels off eventually and approaches its carrying capacity because of limited 
resources. If Pt is the size of the population at time t, we assume that 

dP 

 kP if P is small 
dt 

This says that the growth rate is initially close to being proportional to size. In other words, 
the relative growth rate is almost constant when the population is small. But we also want 
to reflect the fact that the relative growth rate decreases as the population P increases and 
becomes negative if P ever exceeds its carrying capacity K, the maximum population that 
the environment is capable of sustaining in the long run. The simplest expression for the 
relative growth rate that incorporates these assumptions is 

1 dP P 

 k1  

Pdt K 

Multiplying by P, we obtain the model for population growth known as the logistic differential 
equation: 

1 
dP P 

 kP1  

dt K 

Notice from Equation 1 that if P is small compared with K, then PK is close to 0 and so 
dPdt  kP. However, if P l K (the population approaches its carrying capacity), then 
PK l 1, so dPdt l 0. We can deduce information about whether solutions increase or 
decrease directly from Equation 1. If the population P lies between 0 and K, then the right 
side of the equation is positive, so dPdt 
 0 and the population increases. But if the population 
exceeds the carrying capacity P 
 K, then 1  PK is negative, so dPdt  0 
and the population decreases.

Direction Fields 

Let’s start our more detailed analysis of the logistic differential equation by looking at a 
direction field. 

EXAMPLE 1 Draw a direction field for the logistic equation with k  0.08 and carrying 
capacity K  1000. What can you deduce about the solutions? 

SOLUTION In this case the logistic differential equation is 

dP P 

 0.08P1  

dt 1000 
A direction field for this equation is shown in Figure 1. We show only the first quadrant 
because negative populations aren’t meaningful and we are interested only in what happens 
after t  0.

The logistic equation is autonomous (dPdt depends only on P, not on t), so the 
slopes are the same along any horizontal line. As expected, the slopes are positive for 
0  P  1000 and negative for P 
 1000. 

The slopes are small when P is close to 0 or 1000 (the carrying capacity). Notice that 
the solutions move away from the equilibrium solution P  0 and move toward the 
equilibrium solution P  1000. 

In Figure 2 we use the direction field to sketch solution curves with initial populations 
P0  100, P0  400, and P0  1300. Notice that solution curves that start below 
P  1000 are increasing and those that start above P  1000 are decreasing. The slopes 
are greatest when P  500 and, therefore, the solution curves that start below P  1000 
have inflection points when P  500. In fact we can prove that all solution curves that 
start below P  500 have an inflection point when P is exactly 500 (see Exercise 9).

Euler’s Method 

Next let’s use Euler’s method to obtain numerical estimates for solutions of the logistic differential 
equation at specific times. 

EXAMPLE 2 Use Euler’s method with step sizes 20, 10, 5, 1, and 0.1 to estimate the population 
sizes P40and P80, where P is the solution of the initial-value problem

P 

Ft, P 0.08P1  

we get, using the notation of Section 9.2, 
P1  100  20F0, 100 244 
P2  244  20F20, 244539.14

P4  936.69  20F60, 936.691031.57 

Thus, our estimates for the population sizes at times t  40 and t  80 are 
P40539 P801032 
For smaller step sizes we need to program a calculator or computer. The table gives 
the results.

Figure 3 shows a graph of the Euler approximations with step sizes h  10 and h  1.

Section 9.3. Since

Comparison of the Natural Growth and Logistic Models 

In the 1930s the biologist G. F. Gause conducted an experiment with the protozoan Paramecium 
and used a logistic equation to model his data. The table gives his daily count 
of the population of protozoa. He estimated the initial relative growth rate to be 0.7944 and 
the carrying capacity to be 64. 

t (days) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 
P (observed) 2 3 22 16 39 52 54 47 50 76 69 51 57 70 53 59 57 

EXAMPLE 4 Find the exponential and logistic models for Gause’s data. Compare the 
predicted values with the observed values and comment on the fit. 

SOLUTION Given the relative growth rate k  0.7944 and the initial population P0  2, the 
exponential model is 

kt  2e0.7944t

Pt  P0e

Gause used the same value of k for his logistic model. [This is reasonable because 
P0  2 is small compared with the carrying capacity (K  64). The equation 

1 dP 2

  k1  	 k 

P0 dt t0 64 

shows that the value of k for the logistic model is very close to the value for the exponential 
model.] 

Then the solution of the logistic equation in Equation 4 gives

We use these equations to calculate the predicted values (rounded to the nearest integer) 
and compare them in the table.

We notice from the table and from the graph in Figure 5 that for the first three or four 
days the exponential model gives results comparable to those of the more sophisticated 
logistic model. For t  5, however, the exponential model is hopelessly inaccurate, but 
the logistic model fits the observations reasonably well.

Other Models for Population Growth 

The Law of Natural Growth and the logistic differential equation are not the only equations 
that have been proposed to model population growth. In Exercise 14 we look at 
the Gompertz growth function and in Exercises 15 and 16 we investigate seasonalgrowth 
models. 

Two of the other models are modifications of the logistic model. The differential 
equation 

dP P

dt K 

has been used to model populations that are subject to “harvesting” of one sort or another. 
(Think of a population of fish being caught at a constant rate). This equation is explored 
in Exercises 11 and 12. 

For some species there is a minimum population level m below which the species tends 

to become extinct. (Adults may not be able to find suitable mates.) Such populations have 

been modeled by the differential equation 

dP Pm

|||| 9.6 Linear Equations 


A first-order linear differential equation is one that can be put into the form 

1 
dy 

Pxy  Qx 

dx 

where P and Q are continuous functions on a given interval. This type of equation occurs 
frequently in various sciences, as we will see. 

An example of a linear equation is xy
y  2x because, for x  0, it can be written 
in the form 

2 
1 

y
 y  2 

x 

Notice that this differential equation is not separable because it’s impossible to factor the 
expression for y
as a function of x times a function of y. But we can still solve the equation 
by noticing, by the Product Rule, that 

xy
y  xy
 

and so we can rewrite the equation as 

xy
 2x 

If we now integrate both sides of this equation, we get 

C 

xy  x2 C or y  x  

x 

If we had been given the differential equation in the form of Equation 2, we would have 
had to take the preliminary step of multiplying each side of the equation by x. 

It turns out that every first-order linear differential equation can be solved in a similar 
fashion by multiplying both sides of Equation 1 by a suitable function Ix called an 
integrating factor. We try to find I so that the left side of Equation 1, when multiplied by 
Ix, becomes the derivative of the product Ixy: 

3 
Ixy
Pxy  Ixy
 

If we can find such a function I, then Equation 1 becomes 
Ixy
 IxQx 

Integrating both sides, we would have 

Ixy  y IxQx dx C 

so the solution would be 
1 

4 
yx  
y IxQx dx C

Ix 


SECTION 9.6 LINEAR EQUATIONS .... 633 

To find such an I, we expand Equation 3 and cancel terms: 
Ixy
IxPxy  Ixy
 I
xy Ixy
 
IxPx  I
x 
This is a separable differential equation for I, which we solve as follows: 
dI 

y  y Px dx 

I 
ln  I   y Px dx 

I  Aex Px dx

where A  eC. We are looking for a particular integrating factor, not the most general 
one, so we take A  1 and use 

5 
x Px dx

Ix  e

Thus, a formula for the general solution to Equation 1 is provided by Equation 4, where I 
is given by Equation 5. Instead of memorizing this formula, however, we just remember 
the form of the integrating factor. 

To solve the linear differential equation y
Pxy  Qx, multiply both sides by 

x Px dx

the integrating factor Ix  eand integrate both sides.

2 dx  e

Application to Electric Circuits 

In Section 9.2 we considered the simple electric circuit shown in Figure 4: An electromotive 
force (usually a battery or generator) produces a voltage of Et volts (V) and a current 
of It amperes (A) at time t . The circuit also contains a resistor with a resistance of 
R ohms () and an inductor with an inductance of L henries (H). 

Ohm’s Law gives the drop in voltage due to the resistor as RI. The voltage drop due to 
the inductor is LdIdt. One of Kirchhoff’s laws says that the sum of the voltage drops is 
equal to the supplied voltage Et. Thus, we have 

7 
dI 

L  RI  Et 

dt 

which is a first-order linear differential equation. The solution gives the current I at time t . 

EXAMPLE 4 Suppose that in the simple circuit of Figure 4 the resistance is 12  and the 
inductance is 4 H. If a battery gives a constant voltage of 60 V and the switch is closed 
when t  0 so the current starts with I0  0, find (a) It, (b) the current after 1 s, and 

(c) the limiting value of the current. 
SOLUTION 

(a) If we put L  4, R  12, and Et  60 in Equation 7, we obtain the initial-value 
problem

|||| 9.7 Predator-Prey Systems 

We have looked at a variety of models for the growth of a single species that lives alone in 
an environment. In this section we consider more realistic models that take into account 
the interaction of two species in the same habitat. We will see that these models take the 
form of a pair of linked differential equations. 

We first consider the situation in which one species, called the prey, has an ample food 
supply and the second species, called the predators, feeds on the prey. Examples of prey 
and predators include rabbits and wolves in an isolated forest, food fish and sharks, aphids 
and ladybugs, and bacteria and amoebas. Our model will have two dependent variables and 
both are functions of time. We let Rt be the number of prey (using R for rabbits) and Wt 
be the number of predators (with W for wolves) at time t. 

In the absence of predators, the ample food supply would support exponential growth 
of the prey, that is, 

dR 

 kR where k is a positive constant 
dt 

In the absence of prey, we assume that the predator population would decline at a rate proportional 
to itself, that is, 

dW 

 rW where r is a positive constant 

dt 

With both species present, however, we assume that the principal cause of death among the 
prey is being eaten by a predator, and the birth and survival rates of the predators depend 
on their available food supply, namely, the prey. We also assume that the two species 
encounter each other at a rate that is proportional to both populations and is therefore proportional 
to the product RW. (The more there are of either population, the more encounters 
there are likely to be.) A system of two differential equations that incorporates these 

assumptions is as follows: 
W represents the predator. 
R represents the prey. 1

where k, r, a, and b are positive constants. Notice that the term aRW decreases the natural 
growth rate of the prey and the term bRW increases the natural growth rate of the 
predators. 


|||| The Lotka-Volterra equations were proposed 
as a model to explain the variations in the shark 
and food-fish populations in the Adriatic Sea 
by the Italian mathematician Vito Volterra 
(1860–1940). 

SECTION 9.7 PREDATOR-PREY SYSTEMS .... 639 

The equations in (1) are known as the predator-prey equations, or the Lotka-Volterra 
equations. A solution of this system of equations is a pair of functions Rt and Wt that 
describe the populations of prey and predator as functions of time. Because the system is 
coupled (R and W occur in both equations), we can’t solve one equation and then the other; 
we have to solve them simultaneously. Unfortunately, it is usually impossible to find 
explicit formulas for R and W as functions of t. We can, however, use graphical methods 
to analyze the equations. 

EXAMPLE 1 Suppose that populations of rabbits and wolves are described by the Lotka-
Volterra equations (1) with k  0.08, a  0.001, r  0.02, and b  0.00002. The time t 
is measured in months. 

(a) Find the constant solutions (called the equilibrium solutions) and interpret 
the answer. 
(b) Use the system of differential equations to find an expression for dWdR. 
(c) Draw a direction field for the resulting differential equation in the RW-plane. Then 
use that direction field to sketch some solution curves. 
(d) Suppose that, at some point in time, there are 1000 rabbits and 40 wolves. Draw the 
corresponding solution curve and use it to describe the changes in both population levels. 
(e) Use part (d) to make sketches of R and W as functions of t. 
SOLUTION 

(a) With the given values of k, a, r, and b, the Lotka-Volterra equations become 
dR 

 0.08R  0.001RW 

dt 

dW 

 0.02W  0.00002RW 

dt 

Both R and W will be constant if both derivatives are 0, that is, 

R  R0.08  0.001W  0 

W  W0.02  0.00002R  0 

One solution is given by R  0 and W  0. (This makes sense: If there are no rabbits or 
wolves, the populations are certainly not going to increase.) The other constant solution is 

0.08 0.02 
W  80 R  1000 

0.001 0.00002 
So the equilibrium populations consist of 80 wolves and 1000 rabbits. This means that 
1000 rabbits are just enough to support a constant wolf population of 80. There are neither 
too many wolves (which would result in fewer rabbits) nor too few wolves (which 
would result in more rabbits). 

(b) We use the Chain Rule to eliminate t: 
dW dW dR

(c) If we think of W as a function of R, we have the differential equation 
dW 0.02W  0.00002RW 
dR 0.08R  0.001RW 

We draw the direction field for this differential equation in Figure 1 and we use it to 
sketch several solution curves in Figure 2. If we move along a solution curve, we 
observe how the relationship between R and W changes as time passes. Notice that the 
curves appear to be closed in the sense that if we travel along a curve, we always return 
to the same point. Notice also that the point (1000, 80) is inside all the solution curves. 
That point is called an equilibrium point because it corresponds to the equilibrium solution 
R  1000, W  80.

FIGURE 1 Direction field for the predator-prey system FIGURE 2 Phase portrait of the system 

When we represent solutions of a system of differential equations as in Figure 2, we 

refer to the RW-plane as the phase plane, and we call the solution curves phase trajec


tories. So a phase trajectory is a path traced out by solutions R, W as time goes by. A 

phase portrait consists of equilibrium points and typical phase trajectories, as shown in 

Figure 2. 

(d) Starting with 1000 rabbits and 40 wolves corresponds to drawing the solution curve 
through the point P01000, 40. Figure 3 shows this phase trajectory with the direction 
field removed. Starting at the point P0 at time t  0 and letting t increase, do we move 
clockwise or counterclockwise around the phase trajectory? If we put R  1000 and

dR 

 0.081000  0.001100040  80  40  40 

dt 

Since dRdt  0, we conclude that R is increasing at P0 and so we move counterclockwise 
around the phase trajectory. 

We see that at P0 there aren’t enough wolves to maintain a balance between the populations, 
so the rabbit population increases. That results in more wolves and eventually 
there are so many wolves that the rabbits have a hard time avoiding them. So the number 
of rabbits begins to decline (at P1, where we estimate that R reaches its maximum population 
of about 2800). This means that at some later time the wolf population starts to 
fall (at P2, where R  1000 and W  140). But this benefits the rabbits, so their population 
later starts to increase (at P3, where W  80 and R  210). As a consequence, the 
wolf population eventually starts to increase as well. This happens when the populations 
return to their initial values of R  1000 and W  40, and the entire cycle begins again. 

(e) From the description in part (d) of how the rabbit and wolf populations rise and fall, 
we can sketch the graphs of Rt and Wt. Suppose the points P1, P2, and P3 in Figure 3 
are reached at times t1, t2, and t3. Then we can sketch graphs of R and W as in Figure 4.

An important part of the modeling process, as we discussed in Section 1.2, is to interpret 
our mathematical conclusions as real-world predictions and to test the predictions 
against real data. The Hudson’s Bay Company, which started trading in animal furs in 
Canada in 1670, has kept records that date back to the 1840s. Figure 6 shows graphs of the 
number of pelts of the snowshoe hare and its predator, the Canada lynx, traded by the company 
over a 90-year period. You can see that the coupled oscillations in the hare and lynx 
populations predicted by the Lotka-Volterra model do actually occur and the period of 
these cycles is roughly 10 years.

Although the relatively simple Lotka-Volterra model has had some success in explaining 
and predicting coupled populations, more sophisticated models have also been proposed. 
One way to modify the Lotka-Volterra equations is to assume that, in the absence 
of predators, the prey grow according to a logistic model with carrying capacity K. Then 
the Lotka-Volterra equations (1) are replaced by the system of differential equations

This model is investigated in Exercises 9 and 10. 

Models have also been proposed to describe and predict population levels of two 

species that compete for the same resources or cooperate for mutual benefit. Such models 

are explored in Exercise 2.

For each predator-prey system, determine which of the vari-2. Each system of differential equations is a model for two 
ables, x or y, represents the prey population and which species that either compete for the same resources or cooperate 
represents the predator population. Is the growth of the prey for mutual benefit (flowering plants and insect pollinators, for 
restricted just by the predators or by other factors as well? Do instance). Decide whether each system describes competition 
the predators feed only on the prey or do they have additional or cooperation and explain why it is a reasonable model. (Ask 
food sources? Explain. yourself what effect an increase in one species has on the

growth rate of the other.)

the week and 1200 have it at the end of the week. How long

represent letters and other symbols 
on laser printers. See the 
Laboratory Project on page 669.

So far we have described plane curves by giving as a 
function of or as a function of 
or by giving a relation between x and y that defines y

implicitly as a function of x  f x, y  0. In this chapter 
we discuss two new methods for describing curves. 

Some curves, such as the cycloid, are best handled when both x and y are given 
in terms of a third variable t called a parameter x  f t, y  tt. Other curves, 
such as the cardioid, have their most convenient description when we use a new 
coordinate system, called the polar coordinate system.

(x, y)={ f(t), g(t)} 
FIGURE 1 

Imagine that a particle moves along the curve C shown in Figure 1. It is impossible to 
describe C by an equation of the form y  f x because C fails the Vertical Line Test. But 
the x- and y-coordinates of the particle are functions of time and so we can write x  f t 
and y  tt. Such a pair of equations is often a convenient way of describing a curve and 
gives rise to the following definition. 


Suppose that x and y are both given as functions of a third variable t (called a param


x 

eter) by the equations 

x  f t y  tt 

(called parametric equations). Each value of t determines a point x, y, which we can 
plot in a coordinate plane. As t varies, the point x, y   f t, tt varies and traces out a 
curve C, which we call a parametric curve. The parameter t does not necessarily represent 
time and, in fact, we could use a letter other than t for the parameter. But in many 
applications of parametric curves, t does denote time and therefore we can interpret 
x, y   f t, tt as the position of a particle at time t. 

EXAMPLE 1 Sketch and identify the curve defined by the parametric equations 

x  t2  2ty  t  1 

SOLUTION Each value of t gives a point on the curve, as shown in the table. For instance, if 
t  0, then x  0, y  1 and so the corresponding point is 0, 1. In Figure 2 we plot the 
points x, y determined by several values of the parameter and we join them to produce 
a curve.

A particle whose position is given by the parametric equations moves along the curve 
in the direction of the arrows as t increases. Notice that the consecutive points marked on 



652 .... CHAPTER 10 PARAMETRIC EQUATIONS AND POLAR COORDINATES 

the curve appear at equal time intervals but not at equal distances. That is because the 
particle slows down and then speeds up as t increases. 

It appears from Figure 2 that the curve traced out by the particle may be a parabola. 

This can be confirmed by eliminating the parameter t as follows. We obtain t  y  1 

from the second equation and substitute into the first equation. This gives 

x  t2  2t  y  12  2y  1  y2  4y  3 

and so the curve represented by the given parametric equations is the parabola 
x  y2  4y  3. 


No restriction was placed on the parameter t in Example 1, so we assumed that t could 

be any real number. But sometimes we restrict t to lie in a finite interval. For instance, the 

parametric curve 

y 


x  t2  2ty  t  10  t  4

(8, 5) 

shown in Figure 3 is the part of the parabola in Example 1 that starts at the point 0, 1 and 
ends at the point 8, 5. The arrowhead indicates the direction in which the curve is traced 
as t increases from 0 to 4.

EXAMPLE 2 What curve is represented by the parametric equations x  cos t, y  sin t, 

0  t  2? 

SOLUTION If we plot points, it appears that the curve is a circle. We can confirm this 
impression by eliminating t. Observe that 

x2  y2  cos2t  sin2t  1 

Thus, the point x, y moves on the unit circle x2  y2  1. Notice that in this example 
the parameter t can be interpreted as the angle (in radians) shown in Figure 4. As t 

increases from 0 to

x, y  cos t, sin t

moves once around the circle in

curve, in which the points are traced in a particular way. 

EXAMPLE 4 Sketch the curve with parametric equations x  sin t, y  sin2t. 

SOLUTION Observe that y  sin t2  x2 and so the point x, y moves on the parabola 
y  x2. But note also that, since 1  sin t  1, we have 1  x  1, so the parametric 
equations represent only the part of the parabola for which 1  x  1. Since sin t 
is periodic, the point x, y  sin t, sin2t moves back and forth infinitely often along the 
parabola from 1, 1 to 1, 1. (See Figure 6.)

Graphing Devices 
Most graphing calculators and computer graphing programs can be used to graph curves 
defined by parametric equations. In fact, it’s instructive to watch a parametric curve being 
drawn by a graphing calculator because the points are plotted in order as the corresponding 
parameter values increase. 
EXAMPLE 5 Use a graphing device to graph the curve . 
SOLUTION If we let the parameter be , then we have the equations 
Using these parametric equations to graph the curve, we obtain Figure 8. It would be 
possible to solve the given equation for y as four functions of x and 
graph them individually, but the parametric equations provide a much easier method. 
In general, if we need to graph an equation of the form , we can use the parametric 
equations 
Notice also that curves with equations (the ones we are most familiar with— 
graphs of functions) can also be regarded as curves with parametric equations 
Graphing devices are particularly useful when sketching complicated curves. For 
instance, the curves shown in Figures 9 and 10 would be virtually impossible to produce 
by hand. 
One of the most important uses of parametric curves is in computer-aided design 
(CAD). In the Laboratory Project after Section 10.2 we will investigate special parametric 
curves, called Bézier curves, that are used extensively in manufacturing, especially in the 
automotive industry. These curves are also employed in specifying the shapes of letters and 
other symbols in laser printers. 
The Cycloid 
EXAMPLE 6 The curve traced out by a point on the circumference of a circle as the 
circle rolls along a straight line is called a cycloid (see Figure 11). If the circle has 
radius and rolls along the -axis and if one position of is the origin, find parametric 
equations for the cycloid.

2


, it can be seen that these equations are still valid for other 

case where 0  

values of 

(see Exercise 37). 

Cartesian equation in x and y is very complicated and not as convenient to work with as 
the parametric equations. 

One of the first people to study the cycloid was Galileo, who proposed that bridges be 
built in the shape of cycloids and who tried to find the area under one arch of a cycloid. 
Later this curve arose in connection with the brachistochrone problem: Find the curve 
along which a particle will slide in the shortest time (under the influence of gravity) from 
a point A to a lower point B not directly beneath A. The Swiss mathematician John 

B 

Bernoulli, who posed this problem in 1696, showed that among all possible curves that 
FIGURE 13 join A to B, as in Figure 13, the particle will take the least time sliding from A to B if the 
curve is part of an inverted arch of a cycloid. 

The Dutch physicist Huygens had already shown that the cycloid is also the solution to 
the tautochrone problem; that is, no matter where a particle P is placed on an inverted 
cycloid, it takes the same time to slide to the bottom (see Figure 14). Huygens proposed 
that pendulum clocks (which he invented) swing in cycloidal arcs because then the pendulum 
takes the same time to make a complete oscillation whether it swings through a 

FIGURE 14 wide or a small arc.

SOLUTION We use a graphing device to produce the graphs for the cases a  2, 1, 
0.5, 0.2, 0, 0.5, 1, and 2 shown in Figure 15. Notice that all of these curves (except 
the case a  0) have two branches, and both branches approach the vertical asymptote 
x  a as x approaches a from the left or right. 

a=_2 a=_1 a=_0.5 a=_0.2

FIGURE 15 Members of the family When a 1, both branches are smooth; but when a reaches 1, the right branch 
x=a+cos t, y=a tan t+sin t, acquires a sharp point, called a cusp. For a between 1 and 0 the cusp turns into a loop, 
all graphed in the viewing rectangle which becomes larger as a approaches 0. When a  0, both branches come together and 

_4, 4 by _4, 4 

form a circle (see Example 2). For a between 0 and 1, the left branch has a loop, which 
shrinks to become a cusp when a  1. For a 
 1, the branches become smooth again, 
and as a increases further, they become less curved. Notice that the curves with a positive 
are reflections about the y-axis of the corresponding curves with a negative. 

These curves are called conchoids of Nicomedes after the ancient Greek scholar 
Nicomedes. He called them conchoids because the shape of their outer branches 
resembles that of a conch shell or mussel shell.

generated by the motion of a point on a circle that rolls inside or outside another circle.

on the inside of a circle with center O and radius a. Show that if the initial position of P is

|||| 10.2 Calculus with Parametric Curves 

Having seen how to represent curves by parametric equations, we now apply the methods 
of calculus to these parametric curves. In particular, we solve problems involving tangents, 
area, arc length, and surface area. 

Tangents 

In the preceding section we saw that some curves defined by parametric equations x  f t 
and y  tt can also be expressed, by eliminating the parameter, in the form y  Fx. 
(See Exercise 67 for general conditions under which this is possible.) If we substitute 
x  f t and y  tt in the equation y  Fx, we get 

tt  F f t 
and so, if t, F, and f are differentiable, the Chain Rule gives 
tt  F f tf t  Fxf t 
If f t  0, we can solve for Fx: 
tt 

1 
Fx  

f t 

Since the slope of the tangent to the curve y  Fx at x, Fx is Fx, Equation 1 
enables us to find tangents to parametric curves without having to eliminate the parameter. 
Using Leibniz notation, we can rewrite Equation 1 in an easily remembered form: 

|||| If we think of a parametric curve as being dy 
traced out by a moving particle, then dydt and 

dt dx

dy

dxdt are the vertical and horizontal velocities 

2 
 if  0 

of the particle and Formula 2 says that the slope 
of the tangent is the ratio of these velocities. 

dxdx dt 

dt 

It can be seen from Equation 2 that the curve has a horizontal tangent when dydt  0 
(provided that dxdt  0) and it has a vertical tangent when dxdt  0 (provided that 
dydt  0). This information is useful for sketching parametric curves.

EXAMPLE 1 

A curve C is defined by the parametric equations x  t2, y  t3  3t. 

(a) Show that C has two tangents at the point (3, 0) and find their equations. 
(b) Find the points on C where the tangent is horizontal or vertical. 
(c) Determine where the curve is concave upward or downward. 
(d) Sketch the curve. 
SOLUTION 

(a) Notice that y  t3  3t  tt2  3  0 when t  0 or t  	s3. Therefore, the 
point 3, 0 on C arises from two values of the parameter, t  s3 and t  s3. 
This indicates that C crosses itself at 3, 0. Since 
dy dydt 3t2  33 1

t  

dx dxdt 2t 2 t 

the slope of the tangent when t  	s3 is dydx  	6(2s3)  	s3, so the 

equations of the tangents at 3, 0 are 

y  s3 x  3 and y  s3 x  3 

(b) 
C has a horizontal tangent when dydx  0, that is, when dydt  0 and dxdt  0. 
Since dydt  3t2  3, this happens when t2  1, that is, t  	1. The corresponding 
points on C are 1, 2 and (1, 2). C has a vertical tangent when dxdt  2t  0, 
that is, t  0. (Note that dydt  0 there.) The corresponding point on C is (0, 0).

Even if C can’t be expressed in the form y  Fx, Formula 4 is still valid but we obtain 

it by polygonal approximations. We divide the parameter interval 

	

, 


into n subintervals 

x of equal width t. If t0, t1, t2,..., tn are the endpoints of these subintervals, then xi  f ti  
and yi  tti  are the coordinates of points Pixi, yi  that lie on C and the polygon with ver-
FIGURE 4 tices P0, P1 ,..., Pn approximates C (see Figure 4). 
As in Section 8.1, we define the length L of C to be the limit of the lengths of these 
approximating polygons as n l :

The Mean Value Theorem, when applied to f on the interval 	ti1, ti

If we let xi  xi  xi1 and yi  yi  yi1, this equation becomes

Similarly, when applied to t, the Mean Value Theorem gives a number ti ** in ti1, ti  such 
that

The sum in (5) resembles a Riemann sum for the function 

but it is not 

exactly a Riemann sum because ti *  ti ** in general. Nevertheless, if f  and t are continuous, 
it can be shown that the limit in (5) is the same as if ti * and ti ** were equal, namely,

LABORATORY PROJECT 


; Bézier Curves 

The Bézier curves are used in computer-aided design and are named after the French mathematician 
Pierre Bézier (1910–1999), who worked in the automotive industry. A cubic Bézier curve 
is determined by four control points, P0x0, y0 , P1x1, y1, P2x2, y2 , and P3x3, y3 , and is 
defined by the parametric equations 

x  x01  t3  3x1t1  t2  3x2 t21  t  x3 t 3 

y  y01  t3  3y1t1  t2  3y2t 21  t  y3t3 

where 0  t  1. Notice that when t  0 we have x, y  x0, y0  and when t  1 we have 
x, y  x3, y3 , so the curve starts at P0 and ends at P3. 

1. 
Graph the Bézier curve with control points P04, 1, P128, 48, P250, 42, and P340, 5. 
Then, on the same screen, graph the line segments P0P1, P1P2, and P2P3. (Exercise 31 in 
Section 10.1 shows how to do this.) Notice that the middle control points P1 and P2 don’t lie 
on the curve; the curve starts at P0, heads toward P1 and P2 without reaching them, and ends 
at P3. 
2. 
From the graph in Problem 1 it appears that the tangent at P0 passes through P1 and the 
tangent at P3 passes through P2. Prove it. 
3. 
Try to produce a Bézier curve with a loop by changing the second control point in 
Problem 1. 
4. 
Some laser printers use Bézier curves to represent letters and other symbols. Experiment 
with control points until you find a Bézier curve that gives a reasonable representation of the 
letter C. 
5. 
More complicated shapes can be represented by piecing together two or more Bézier curves. 
Suppose the first Bézier curve has control points P0, P1, P2, P3 and the second one has control 
points P3, P4, P5, P6. If we want these two pieces to join together smoothly, then the 
tangents at P3 should match and so the points P2, P3, and P4 all have to lie on this common 
tangent line. Using this principle, find control points for a pair of Bézier curves that represent 
the letter S. 
|||| 10.3 Polar Coordinates 

A coordinate system represents a point in the plane by an ordered pair of numbers called 
coordinates. Usually we use Cartesian coordinates, which are directed distances from two 
perpendicular axes. Here we describe a coordinate system introduced by Newton, called 
the polar coordinate system, which is more convenient for many purposes. 

P (r, ¨ ) We choose a point in the plane that is called the pole (or origin) and is labeled O. Then 
we draw a ray (half-line) starting at O called the polar axis. This axis is usually drawn hor-

increases from 0 to

increases from 1 to 2, so we sketch the corresponding part of the polar curve in Figure

Graphing Polar Curves with Graphing Devices

Although it’s useful to be able to sketch simple polar curves by hand, we need to use a 
graphing calculator or computer when we are faced with a curve as complicated as the one 
shown in Figure 16. 

Some graphing devices have commands that enable us to graph polar curves directly. 
With other machines we need to convert to parametric equations first. In this case we take

EXAMPLE 11 Investigate the family of polar curves given by r  1  c sin

the shape change as c changes? (These curves are called limaçons, after a French word 
for snail, because of the shape of the curves for certain values of c.) 

SOLUTION Figure 18 shows computer-drawn graphs for various values of c. For c  1 
there is a loop that decreases in size as c decreases. When c  1 the loop disappears and 
the curve becomes the cardioid that we sketched in Example 7. For c between 1 and 12 the

SOLUTION The cardioid (see Example 7 in Section 10.3) and the circle are sketched in

by finding the points of intersection of the two curves. They intersect when

| CAUTION The fact that a single point has many representations in polar coordinates 
sometimes makes it difficult to find all the points of intersection of two polar curves. For 
instance, it is obvious from Figure 5 that the circle and the cardioid have three points 

and

of intersection; however, in Example 2 we solved the equations r  3 sin 

r  1  sin 

and found only two such points, 

(
(
32, 

6) 


and 

(
(
32, 5

6)


. The origin is also 

a point of intersection, but we can’t find it by solving the equations of the curves because 
the origin has no single representation in polar coordinates that satisfies both equations. 

and so it

0, 00,


Notice that, when represented as 

, the origin satisfies r  3sin

or 

0, 32.


, it satisfies r  1  sin

lies on the circle; when represented as 

and so it lies on 

the cardioid. Think of two points moving along the curves as the parameter value 

increases from 0 to 

2. On one curve the origin is reached at 

 0 and 
; on the 
other curve it is reached at 

 32


. The points don’t collide at the origin because they 

reach the origin at different times, but the curves intersect there nonetheless. 

Thus, to find all points of intersection of two polar curves, it is recommended that you 
draw the graphs of both curves. It is especially convenient to use a graphing calculator or 
computer to help with this task.

In this section we give geometric definitions of parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas and 
derive their standard equations. They are called conic sections, or conics, because they 
result from intersecting a cone with a plane as shown in Figure 1. 

FIGURE 1

Parabolas 

A parabola is the set of points in a plane that are equidistant from a fixed point F (called 
the focus) and a fixed line (called the directrix). This definition is illustrated by Figure 2. 
Notice that the point halfway between the focus and the directrix lies on the parabola; it is 
called the vertex. The line through the focus perpendicular to the directrix is called the 
axis of the parabola. 

In the 16th century Galileo showed that the path of a projectile that is shot into the 
air at an angle to the ground is a parabola. Since then, parabolic shapes have been used

(See Problem 16 on page 276 for the reflection property of parabolas that makes them so 
useful.) 

y 

We obtain a particularly simple equation for a parabola if we place its vertex at the oriP(
x, y) gin O and its directrix parallel to the x-axis as in Figure 3. If the focus is the point 0, p, 
then the directrix has the equation y  p. If Px, y is any point on the parabola, then the 

F(0, p) 

y distance from P to the focus is 

px  PF   sx2  y  p2 

and the distance from P to the directrix is  y  p . (Figure 3 illustrates the case where 

O 

y=_p 

p  0.) The defining property of a parabola is that these distances are equal: 

FIGURE 3 

sx2  y  p2   y  p  

We get an equivalent equation by squaring and simplifying: 

x2  y  p2   y  p 2  y  p2 
x2  y2  2py  p2  y2  2py  p2 
x2  4py

An equation of the parabola with focus 0, p and directrix y  p is 
x2  4py 

If we write a  14p, then the standard equation of a parabola (1) becomes y  ax2. 
It opens upward if p  0 and downward if p  0 [see Figure 4, parts (a) and (b)]. The 
graph is symmetric with respect to the y-axis because (1) is unchanged when x is replaced 
by x.

If we interchange x and y in (1), we obtain

which is an equation of the parabola with focus p, 0 and directrix x  p. (Interchanging 
x and y amounts to reflecting about the diagonal line y  x.) The parabola opens 
to the right if p  0 and to the left if p  0 [see Figure 4, parts (c) and (d)]. In both cases 
the graph is symmetric with respect to the x-axis, which is the axis of the parabola.

EXAMPLE 1 Find the focus and directrix of the parabola y2  10x  0 and sketch 
the graph. 

SOLUTION If we write the equation as y2  10x and compare it with Equation 2, we see 
that 4p  10, so p  25. Thus, the focus is  p, 0  (25, 0) and the directrix is 
x  25. The sketch is shown in Figure 5. 

Ellipses 

An ellipse is the set of points in a plane the sum of whose distances from two fixed points 
F1 and F2 is a constant (see Figure 6). These two fixed points are called the foci (plural of 
focus). One of Kepler’s laws is that the orbits of the planets in the solar system are ellipses 
with the Sun at one focus. 

In order to obtain the simplest equation for an ellipse, we place the foci on the x-axis at 
the points c, 0 and c, 0 as in Figure 7 so that the origin is halfway between the foci. 
Let the sum of the distances from a point on the ellipse to the foci be 2a  0. Then Px, y 
is a point on the ellipse when 

 PF1    PF2   2a 

that is, sx  c2  y2  sx  c2  y2  2a 

or sx  c2  y2  2a  sx  c2  y2 

Squaring both sides, we have 

x2  2cx  c2  y2  4a2  4asx  c2  y2  x2  2cx  c2  y2 

which simplifies to asx  c2  y2  a2  cx 

We square again: 

a2x2  2cx  c2  y2   a4  2a2cx  c2x2 

which becomes a2  c2 x2  a2 y2  a2a2  c2  

From triangle F1F2P in Figure 7 we see that 2c  2a, so c  a and, therefore, 
a2  c2  0. For convenience, let b2  a2  c2. Then the equation of the ellipse becomes 
b22  a2  a2b22b2

x2 yor, if both sides are divided by a, 

3 
x2 y2 
2   1 

b2

a

Since b2  a2  c2  a2, it follows that b  a. The x-intercepts are found by setting 
y  0. Then x2a2  1, or x2  a2, so x  a. The corresponding points a, 0 and 
a, 0 are called the vertices of the ellipse and the line segment joining the vertices 
is called the major axis. To find the y-intercepts we set x  0 and obtain y2  b2, so 
y  b. Equation 3 is unchanged if x is replaced by x or y is replaced by y, so the 
ellipse is symmetric about both axes. Notice that if the foci coincide, then c  0, so a  b 
and the ellipse becomes a circle with radius r  a  b. 

We summarize this discussion as follows (see also Figure 8).

SECTION 10.5 CONIC SECTIONS .... 687 

If the foci of an ellipse are located on the y-axis at 0, c, then we can find its equation 
by interchanging x and y in (4). (See Figure 9.)

EXAMPLE 2 Sketch the graph of 9x2  16y2  144 and locate the foci. 

SOLUTION Divide both sides of the equation by 144: 

x2 y2 

  1 

16 9 

The equation is now in the standard form for an ellipse, so we have a2  16, b2  9, 
a  4, and b  3. The x-intercepts are 4 and the y-intercepts are 3. Also, 
c2  a2  b2  7, so c  s7 and the foci are (s7, 0). The graph is sketched in 
Figure 10. 

EXAMPLE 3 Find an equation of the ellipse with foci 0, 2 and vertices 0, 3. 

SOLUTION Using the notation of (5), we have c  2 and a  3. Then we obtain 
b2  a2  c2  9  4  5, so an equation of the ellipse is 

22

Another way of writing the equation is 9x2  5y2  45. 

Like parabolas, ellipses have an interesting reflection property that has practical consequences. 
If a source of light or sound is placed at one focus of a surface with elliptical 
cross-sections, then all the light or sound is reflected off the surface to the other focus (see 
Exercise 59). This principle is used in lithotripsy, a treatment for kidney stones. A reflector 
with elliptical cross-section is placed in such a way that the kidney stone is at one focus. 
High-intensity sound waves generated at the other focus are reflected to the stone and 
destroy it without damaging surrounding tissue. The patient is spared the trauma of surgery 
and recovers within a few days. 

Hyperbolas 

A hyperbola is the set of all points in a plane the difference of whose distances from two 
fixed points F1 and F2 (the foci) is a constant. This definition is illustrated in Figure 11. 

Hyperbolas occur frequently as graphs of equations in chemistry, physics, biology, and 
economics (Boyle’s Law, Ohm’s Law, supply and demand curves). A particularly significant 
application of hyperbolas is found in the navigation systems developed in World Wars 
I and II (see Exercise 51). 

Notice that the definition of a hyperbola is similar to that of an ellipse; the only change 
is that the sum of distances has become a difference of distances. In fact, the derivation of 
the equation of a hyperbola is also similar to the one given earlier for an ellipse. It is left

as Exercise 52 to show that when the foci are on the x-axis at c, 0 and the difference of

where c2  a2 b2. Notice that the x-intercepts are again a and the points a, 0 and 
a, 0 are the vertices of the hyperbola. But if we put x  0 in Equation 6 we get 
y2  b2, which is impossible, so there is no y-intercept. The hyperbola is symmetric 
with respect to both axes. 

To analyze the hyperbola further, we look at Equation 6 and obtain

This shows that x, so  x 

means that the hyperbola consists of two parts, called its branches. 

When we draw a hyperbola it is useful to first draw its asymptotes, which are the dashed 
lines y  bax and y  bax shown in Figure 12. Both branches of the hyperbola 
approach the asymptotes; that is, they come arbitrarily close to the asymptotes. [See 
Exercise 67 in Section 4.5, where y  bax is shown to be a slant asymptote.]

SOLUTION From (8) and the given information, we see that a  1 and ab  2. Thus, 
b  a2  21 and c2  a2  b2  45. The foci are (0, s52) and the equation of the 
hyperbola is 

y2  4x2  1 

Shifted Conics 

As discussed in Appendix C, we shift conics by taking the standard equations (1), (2), (4), 
(5), (7), and (8) and replacing x and y by x  h and y  k. 

EXAMPLE 6 Find an equation of the ellipse with foci 2, 2, 4, 2 and vertices 
1, 2, 5, 2. 

SOLUTION The major axis is the line segment that joins the vertices 1, 2, 5, 2 
and has length 4, so a  2. The distance between the foci is 2, so c  1. Thus, 
b2  a2  c2  3. Since the center of the ellipse is 3, 2, we replace x and y in (4) 
by x  3 and y  2 to obtain 

x  32 y  22 

  1 

43 

as the equation of the ellipse. 

EXAMPLE 7 Sketch the conic 

9x2  4y2  72x  8y  176  0 

and find its foci. 

SOLUTION We complete the squares as follows: 

4y2  2y  9x2  8x  176 

4y2  2y  1  9x2  8x  16  176  4  144

y  12 x  42 

  1

94 

This is in the form (8) except that x and y are replaced by x  4 and y  1. Thus, 
a2  9, b2  4, and c2  13. The hyperbola is shifted four units to the right and one 
unit upward. The foci are (4, 1  s13) and (4, 1  s13) and the vertices are 4, 4 and 
4, 2. The asymptotes are y  1  23 x  4. The hyperbola is sketched in 
Figure 15.

|||| 10.6 Conic Sections in Polar Coordinates 

In the preceding section we defined the parabola in terms of a focus and directrix, but we 
defined the ellipse and hyperbola in terms of two foci. In this section we give a more unified 
treatment of all three types of conic sections in terms of a focus and directrix. Furthermore, 
if we place the focus at the origin, then a conic section has a simple polar equation. 
In Chapter 13 we will use the polar equation of an ellipse to derive Kepler’s laws of planetary 
motion. 

1 
Theorem Let F be a fixed point (called the focus) and l be a fixed line (called 

the directrix) in a plane. Let e be a fixed positive number (called the eccentricity). 
The set of all points P in the plane such that

 (The ratio of the distance from F to 
Pl the distance from l is the constant e.)

is a conic section. The conic is 

(a) an ellipse if e  1 
(b) a parabola if e  1 
(c) a hyperbola if e  1 
Proof Notice that if the eccentricity is e  1, then  PF    Pl  and so the given condition 
simply becomes the definition of a parabola as given in Section 10.5. 
Let us place the focus F at the origin and the directrix parallel to the y-axis and 

polar axis. If the point

Infinite Sequences and Series 
Bessel functions, which are 
used to model the vibrations 
of drumheads and 
cymbals, are defined as 
sums of infinite series in 
Section 11.8. Notice how 
closely the computergenerated 
models (which 
involve Bessel functions 
and cosine functions) 
match the photographs of a 
vibrating rubber membrane.

Infinite sequences and series were introduced briefly in A 
Preview of Calculus in connection with Zeno’s paradoxes 
and the decimal representation of numbers. Their impor


tance in calculus stems from Newton’s idea of representing 
functions as sums of infinite series. For instance, in finding 
areas he often integrated a function by first expressing it as a series and then integrating 
each term of the series. We will pursue his idea in Section 11.10 in order 
to integrate such functions as ex 2. (Recall that we have previously been unable to 
do this.) Many of the functions that arise in mathematical physics and chemistry, 
such as Bessel functions, are defined as sums of series, so it is important to be familiar 
with the basic concepts of convergence of infinite sequences and series. 

Physicists also use series in another way, as we will see in Section 11.12. In studying 
fields as diverse as optics, special relativity, and electromagnetism, they analyze 
phenomena by replacing a function with the first few terms in the series that 
represents it. 

|||| 11.1 Sequences 

A sequence can be thought of as a list of numbers written in a definite order: 

a1, a2, a3, a4, ..., an, ... 

The number a1 is called the first term, a2 is the second term, and in general an is the nth 
term. We will deal exclusively with infinite sequences and so each term an will have a 
successor an1. 

Notice that for every positive integer n there is a corresponding number an and so a 
sequence can be defined as a function whose domain is the set of positive integers. But we 
usually write an instead of the function notation f n for the value of the function at the 
number .

EXAMPLE 1 Some sequences can be defined by giving a formula for the nth term. In the 
following examples we give three descriptions of the sequence: one by using the preceding 
notation, another by using the defining formula, and a third by writing out the terms 
of the sequence. Notice that n doesn’t have to start at 1.

Notice that the numerators of these fractions start with 3 and increase by 1 whenever we 
go to the next term. The second term has numerator 4, the third term has numerator 5; in 
general, the th term will have numerator . The denominators are the powers of 5, 
so has denominator . The signs of the terms are alternately positive and negative, so 
we need to multiply by a power of . In Example 1(b) the factor meant we

704 .... CHAPTER 11 INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES 

Definition 2 is illustrated by Figure 4, in which the terms a1, a2, a3, . . . are plotted on 
a number line. No matter how small an interval L 	, L 	 is chosen, there exists an 
N such that all terms of the sequence from aN1 onward must lie in that interval.

Another illustration of Definition 2 is given in Figure 5. The points on the graph of an  
must lie between the horizontal lines y  L 	and y  L 	if n N. This picture 
must be valid no matter how small 	is chosen, but usually a smaller 	requires a larger N.

Comparison of Definition 2 and Definition 2.6.7 shows that the only difference between 
limn l  an  L and limx l  f x  L is that n is required to be an integer. Thus, we have 
the following theorem, which is illustrated by Figure 6.

Some computer algebra systems have special 
commands that enable us to create sequences 
and graph them directly. With most graphing 
calculators, however, sequences can be graphed 
by using parametric equations. For instance, the 
sequence in Example 8 can be graphed by entering 
the parametric equations 

x  ty  t!tt 
and graphing in dot mode starting with t  1, 
setting the -step equal to 1. The result is shown

Definition A sequence an  is called increasing if an an1 for all n 1, that 
is, a1 a2 a3 . It is called decreasing if an an1 for all n 1. It is 
called monotonic if it is either increasing or decreasing. 
EXAMPLE 10 The sequence is decreasing because

SOLUTION 1 We must show that an1 an, that is,

This inequality is equivalent to the one we get by cross-multiplication:

Since n 1, we know that the inequality n2 n 1 is true. Therefore, an1 an and 
so an  is decreasing.

Monotonic Sequence Theorem11

Proof Suppose an  is an increasing sequence. Since an  is bounded, the set 
S  an 	 n 1 has an upper bound. By the Completeness Axiom it has a least upper 
bound L. Given 	0, L 	is not an upper bound for S (since L is the least upper 
bound). Therefore 

aN L 	 for some integer N 

But the sequence is increasing so an aN for every n N. Thus, if n N we have 

an L 	 

so 0 
L an 	 
since an 
L. Thus 
	 L an 	 	 whenever n N 
so limn l  an  L. 
A similar proof (using the greatest lower bound) works if an  is decreasing. 
The proof of Theorem 11 shows that a sequence that is increasing and bounded above 
is convergent. (Likewise, a decreasing sequence that is bounded below is convergent.) This 
fact is used many times in dealing with infinite series.

so ak1 6 ak 6 

and 21 ak1 6 21 ak 6 

Thus ak2 ak1 

We have deduced that an1 an is true for n  k 1. Therefore, the inequality is true 
for all n by induction. 

Next we verify that an  is bounded by showing that an 6 for all n. (Since the 

sequence is increasing, we already know that it has a lower bound: an a1  2 for 

all n.) We know that a1 6, so the assertion is true for n  1. Suppose it is true for 

n  k. Then 

ak 6 

so ak 6 12

Thus ak1 6 

This shows, by mathematical induction, that an 6 for all n. 

Since the sequence an  is increasing and bounded, Theorem 11 guarantees that it has 

a limit. The theorem doesn’t tell us what the value of the limit is. But now that we know 

L  limn l  an exists, we can use the recurrence relation to write

Solving this equation for L, we get L  6, as predicted.

Logistic Sequences 
A sequence that arises in ecology as a model for population growth is defined by the logistic 
difference equation 
where measures the size of the population of the generation of a single species. To keep 
the numbers manageable, is a fraction of the maximal size of the population, so . 
Notice that the form of this equation is similar to the logistic differential equation in Section 9.5. 
The discrete model—with sequences instead of continuous functions—is preferable for modeling 
insect populations, where mating and death occur in a periodic fashion. 
An ecologist is interested in predicting the size of the population as time goes on, and asks 
these questions: Will it stabilize at a limiting value? Will it change in a cyclical fashion? Or will 
it exhibit random behavior? 
Write a program to compute the first terms of this sequence starting with an initial population 
. Use this program to do the following. 
1. Calculate 20 or 30 terms of the sequence for and for two values of such that 
. Graph the sequences. Do they appear to converge? Repeat for a different value 
of between 0 and 1. Does the limit depend on the choice of ? Does it depend on the 
choice of ? 
2. Calculate terms of the sequence for a value of between 3 and 3.4 and plot them. What do 
you notice about the behavior of the terms? 
3. Experiment with values of between 3.4 and 3.5. What happens to the terms? 
4. For values of between 3.6 and 4, compute and plot at least 100 terms and comment on the 
behavior of the sequence. What happens if you change by 0.001? This type of behavior is 
called chaotic and is exhibited by insect populations under certain conditions.

|||| What do we really mean when we say that 
the sum of the series in Example 2 is 3? Of 
course, we can’t literally add an infinite number 
of terms, one by one. But, according to Definition 
2, the total sum is the limit of the sequence of 
partial sums. So, by taking the sum of sufficiently 
many terms, we can get as close as we like to 
the number 3. The table shows the first ten partial 
sums sn and the graph in Figure 2 shows how 
the sequence of partial sums approaches 3.

Theorem If the series  an is convergent, then lim an  0.

n1 

Proof Let sn  a1 a2 an. Then an  sn sn1. Since  an is convergent, the 
sequence sn  is convergent. Let limn l  sn  s. Since n 1 l as n l , we also 
have limn l  sn1  s. Therefore 

lim an  lim sn sn1  lim sn  lim sn1 

n l  n l  n l  n l  

 s s  0

NOTE 1 With any series  an we associate two sequences: the sequence sn  of its partial 
sums and the sequence an  of its terms. If  an is convergent, then the limit of the 
sequence sn  is s (the sum of the series) and, as Theorem 6 asserts, the limit of the 
sequence an  is 0. 



| NOTE 2 The converse of Theorem 6 is not true in general. If limn l  an  0, we cannot 
conclude that  an is convergent. Observe that for the harmonic series  1
n we have 
an  1
n l 0 as n l , but we showed in Example 7 that  1
n is divergent. 

7 
The Test for Divergence If lim an does not exist or if lim an  0, then the 
n l  n l  

series  an is divergent. 

n1 

The Test for Divergence follows from Theorem 6 because, if the series is not divergent, 
then it is convergent, and so limn l  an  0.

NOTE 3 If we find that limn l  an  0, we know that  an is divergent. If we find that 
limn l  an  0, we know nothing about the convergence or divergence of  an. Remember 
the warning in Note 2: If limn l  an  0, the series  an might converge or it might 
diverge.

The nth partial sum for the series an  bn  is

The Cantor set, named after the German mathematician Georg 
Cantor (1845–1918), is constructed as follows. We start with 
the closed interval [0, 1] and remove the open interval (31, 32). 
That leaves the two intervals [0, 13 ] and [ 32, 1] and we remove 
the open middle third of each. Four intervals remain and again 
we remove the open middle third of each of them. We continue 
this procedure indefinitely, at each step removing the open 
middle third of every interval that remains from the preceding 
step. The Cantor set consists of the numbers that remain in 
[0, 1] after all those intervals have been removed.

In general, it is difficult to find the exact sum of a series. We were able to accomplish this 
for geometric series and the series  1	nn 1
 because in each of those cases we could 
find a simple formula for the nth partial sum sn. But usually it isn’t easy to compute 
limn l  sn. Therefore, in the next few sections we develop several tests that enable us to 
determine whether a series is convergent or divergent without explicitly finding its sum. 
(In some cases, however, our methods will enable us to find good estimates of the sum.) 
Our first test involves improper integrals. 

We begin by investigating the series whose terms are the reciprocals of the squares of 
the positive integers: 

n 1  111111 

sn   i2  2       

i1 n1 n12 22 32 42 52 

1.4636 

There’s no simple formula for the sum sn of the first n terms, but the computer-generated 

1.5498 

table of values given in the margin suggests that the partial sums are approaching a num


1.6251 

ber near 1.64 as n l and so it looks as if the series is convergent. 

1.6350 

We can confirm this impression with a geometric argument. Figure 1 shows the curve 

1.6429 

y  1x2 and rectangles that lie below the curve. The base of each rectangle is an interval 

1.6439 

of length 1; the height is equal to the value of the function y  1x2 at the right endpoint

1.6447 

of the interval. So the sum of the areas of the rectangles is

If we exclude the first rectangle, the total area of the remaining rectangles is smaller 
than the area under the curve y  1x2 for x 
1, which is the value of the integral 
1 
 1x2  dx. In Section 7.8 we discovered that this improper integral is convergent and has 
value 1. So the picture shows that all the partial sums are less than 

1  1 

dx  2

y 2

12 1 x

Thus, the partial sums are bounded. We also know that the partial sums are increasing 
(because all the terms are positive). Therefore, the partial sums converge (by the Monotonic 
Sequence Theorem) and so the series is convergent. The sum of the series (the limit 
of the partial sums) is also less than 2:

[The exact sum of this series was found by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler 
(1707–1783) to be 26, but the proof of this fact is quite difficult. (See Problem 6 in the 
Problems Plus following Chapter 15.)]

3.2317 n1 sn s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 
5.0210 


The table of values of sn suggests that the partial sums aren’t approaching a finite number, 

12.7524 
18.5896 so we suspect that the given series may be divergent. Again we use a picture for confir43.2834 
mation. Figure 2 shows the curve y  1sx, but this time we use rectangles whose tops 
61.8010 lie above the curve.

The base of each rectangle is an interval of length 1. The height is equal to the value of 

the function y  1sx at the left endpoint of the interval. So the sum of the areas of all the 

rectangles is 

11111  1 

     

s1 s2 s3 s4 s5 n1 sn 

This total area is greater than the area under the curve y  1sx for x 
1, which is equal 
to the integral x1 
 (1sx) dx. But we know from Section 7.8 that this improper integral is 
divergent. In other words, the area under the curve is infinite. So the sum of the series must 
be infinite; that is, the series is divergent. 

The same sort of geometric reasoning that we used for these two series can be used to 
prove the following test. (The proof is given at the end of this section.) 

The Integral Test Suppose f is a continuous, positive, decreasing function on 	1,  
and let an  f n. Then the series  
n1 an is convergent if and only if the improper 
integral x1 
 f x dx is convergent. In other words: 

(i) If y  f x dx is convergent, then  an is convergent.

n1 

(ii) If y  f x dx is divergent, then  an is divergent.

NOTE When we use the Integral Test it is not necessary to start the series or the integral 
at n  1. For instance, in testing the series 

 1  1

 we use y4 
dx 
n4 n 32 x 32 

SECTION 11.3 THE INTEGRAL TEST AND ESTIMATES OF SUMS .... 725 

Also, it is not necessary that f be always decreasing. What is important is that f be ultimately 
decreasing, that is, decreasing for x larger than some number N. Then  
nN an is 
convergent, so n
 
1 an is convergent by Note 4 of Section 11.2. 

EXAMPLE 1 Test the series   1

n1 n

SOLUTION The function f x  1x2 1 is continuous, positive, and decreasing on

4 244 

 lim 

t l  

Thus, x1
 1x2 1 dx 

is a convergent integral and so, by the Integral Test, the series 

 1n

2 1 is convergent. 


EXAMPLE 2 For what values of p is the series   1 
p convergent? 

n

n1 

SOLUTION If p 0, then limn l  1np   . If p  0, then limn l  1np   1. In either 
case limn l  1np   0, so the given series diverges by the Test for Divergence (11.2.7). 

If p 0, then the function f x  1xp is clearly continuous, positive, and decreasing 
on 	1, . We found in Chapter 7 [see (7.8.2)] that 

 1 

y dx converges if p 1 and diverges if p 	1 

p

It follows from the Integral Test that the series  1nconverges if p 1 and diverges 
if 0 p 	1. (For p  1, this series is the harmonic series discussed in Example 7 in 
Section 11.2.) 


The series in Example 2 is called the p-series. It is important in the rest of this chapter, 
so we summarize the results of Example 2 for future reference as follows.

EXAMPLE 4 Determine whether the series  converges or diverges. 

n1 n 

SOLUTION The function f x  ln xx is positive and continuous for x 1 because the 
logarithm function is continuous. But it is not obvious whether or not f is decreasing, so 
we compute its derivative: 

1x x ln x 1 ln x 

f x  2  2

xx

Thus, f  x 0 when ln x 1, that is, x e. It follows that f is decreasing when x e 
and so we can apply the Integral Test: 

 ln xt ln x ln x2 t

Since this improper integral is divergent, the series ln nn is also divergent by the 
Integral Test.

Estimating the Sum of a Series

Suppose we have been able to use the Integral Test to show that a series  an is convergent 
and we now want to find an approximation to the sum s of the series. Of course, any 
partial sum sn is an approximation to s because limn l  sn  s. But how good is such an 
approximation? To find out, we need to estimate the size of the remainder

Find all positive values of b for which the series

In the comparison tests the idea is to compare a given series with a series that is known to 
be convergent or divergent. For instance, the series 

 1 

n12n

1 


reminds us of the series n
 
1 12n, which is a geometric series with a  21 and r  21 and 
is therefore convergent. Because the series (1) is so similar to a convergent series, we have 
the feeling that it too must be convergent. Indeed, it is. The inequality 

11 

2n 2n

1 

shows that our given series (1) has smaller terms than those of the geometric series and 
therefore all its partial sums are also smaller than 1 (the sum of the geometric series). This 
means that its partial sums form a bounded increasing sequence, which is convergent. It 


SECTION 11.4 THE COMPARISON TESTS .... 731 

also follows that the sum of the series is less than the sum of the geometric series: 

 1

 2n  1 

n1  1 

Similar reasoning can be used to prove the following test, which applies only to series 
whose terms are positive. The first part says that if we have a series whose terms are 
smaller than those of a known convergent series, then our series is also convergent. The 
second part says that if we start with a series whose terms are larger than those of a known 
divergent series, then it too is divergent. 

The Comparison Test Suppose that  an and  bn are series with positive terms. 

(i) If  bn is convergent and an 	 bn for all n, then  an is also convergent. 
(ii) If  bn is divergent and an  bn for all n, then  an is also divergent. 
|||| It is important to keep in mind the distinction Proof 
between a sequence and a series. A sequence is 

(i) Let 
a list of numbers, whereas a series is a sum. 

nn  
With every series  an there are associated two

sequences: the sequence  of terms and the

an i1 i1 n1 
sequence sn  of partial sums. 
Since both series have positive terms, the sequences sn  and tn  are increasing 
sn1  sn  an1  sn 	. Also tn l t, so tn 	 t for all n. Since ai 	 bi, we have sn 	 tn. 
Thus, sn 	 t for all n. This means that sn  is increasing and bounded above and therefore 
converges by the Monotonic Sequence Theorem. Thus,  an converges. 

(ii) If  bn is divergent, then tn l  (since tn  is increasing). But ai  bi so sn  tn. 
Thus, sn l . Therefore,  an diverges. 
Standard Series for Use In using the Comparison Test we must, of course, have some known series  bn for the

because the left side has a bigger denominator. (In the notation of the Comparison Test,

NOTE 1 Although the condition an 	 bn or an  bn in the Comparison Test is given for 
all n, we need verify only that it holds for n  N, where N is some fixed integer, because 
the convergence of a series is not affected by a finite number of terms. This is illustrated 
in the next example.

We know that  1n is divergent ( p-series with p  1). Thus, the given series is divergent

NOTE 2 The terms of the series being tested must be smaller than those of a convergent 
series or larger than those of a divergent series. If the terms are larger than the terms of a 
convergent series or smaller than those of a divergent series, then the Comparison Test 
doesn’t apply. Consider, for instance, the series

is useless as far as the Comparison Test is concerned because  bn   (12 is convergent 
and an  bn. Nonetheless, we have the feeling that  12n  1	 ought to be convergent 
because it is very similar to the convergent geometric series  (21 )n. In such cases the following 
test can be used. 

The Limit Comparison Test Suppose that  an and  bn are series with positive terms. If 

an

n l  bn 

where c is a finite number and c  0, then either both series converge or both

Proof Let m and M be positive numbers such that m  c  M. Because anbn is close to 
c for large n, there is an integer N such that

SECTION 11.4 THE COMPARISON TESTS .... 733 

If  bn converges, so does  Mbn. Thus,  an converges by part (i) of the Comparison 
Test. If  bn diverges, so does  mbn and part (ii) of the Comparison Test shows that  an 
diverges.

Since an 	 bn for all n, we have Rn 	 Tn. If  bn is a p-series, we can estimate its remainder 
Tn as in Section 11.3. If  bn is a geometric series, then Tn is the sum of a geometric 
series and we can sum it exactly (see Exercises 35 and 36). In either case we know that Rn 
is smaller than Tn.

|||| 11.5 Alternating Series 

The convergence tests that we have looked at so far apply only to series with positive 
terms. In this section and the next we learn how to deal with series whose terms are not 
necessarily positive. Of particular importance are alternating series, whose terms alternate 
in sign. 

An alternating series is a series whose terms are alternately positive and negative. Here 
are two examples:

234567 n1 n 1


736 .... CHAPTER 11 INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES 

We see from these examples that the nth term of an alternating series is of the form 

an  1	n1bn or an  1	nbn 

where bn is a positive number. (In fact, bn   an .) 

The following test says that if the terms of an alternating series decrease toward 0 in 

absolute value, then the series converges. 

The Alternating Series Test If the alternating series 

1	n1bn  b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6  bn 0	 

n1 

satisfies 

(i) bn1 	bn for all n 
(ii) lim bn  0 
n l  

then the series is convergent. 

Before giving the proof let’s look at Figure 1, which gives a picture of the idea behind 
the proof. We first plot s1  b1 on a number line. To find s2 we subtract b2, so s2 is to the 
left of s1. Then to find s3 we add b3, so s3 is to the right of s2. But, since b3 b2, s3 is to 
the left of s1. Continuing in this manner, we see that the partial sums oscillate back and 
forth. Since bn l 0, the successive steps are becoming smaller and smaller. The even partial 
sums s2, s4, s6,... are increasing and the odd partial sums s1, s3, s5,... are decreasing. 
Thus, it seems plausible that both are converging to some number s, which is the sum of 
the series. Therefore, in the following proof we consider the even and odd partial sums 
separately.

s4  s2 b3 b4 	 s2 since b4 	b3 
In general s2n  s2n2 b2n1 b2n 	 s2n2 since b2n 	b2n1 
Thus 0 	s2 	s4 	s6 		s2n 	 

But we can also write

Every term in brackets is positive, so s2n 	b1 for all n. Therefore, the sequence s2n  of 
even partial sums is increasing and bounded above. It is therefore convergent by the 
Monotonic Sequence Theorem. Let’s call its limit s, that is, 

lim s2n  s 

n l  

Now we compute the limit of the odd partial sums: 

lim s2n1  lim s2n b2n1. 
n l  n l . 


 lim s2n lim b2n1

n l  n l  

 s 0 [by condition (ii)] 

 s 

Since both the even and odd partial sums converge to s, we have limn l  sn  s (see 
Exercise 72 in Section 11.1) and so the series is convergent.

SOLUTION The given series is alternating so we try to verify conditions (i) and (ii) of the

Unlike the situation in Example 1, it is not obvious that the sequence given by

and therefore bn1  bn when n  2. (The inequality b2  b1 can be verified directly but

Estimating Sums 

|||| You can see geometrically why the 
Alternating Series Estimation Theorem is true 
by looking at Figure 1 (on page 736). Notice that 
s  s4  b5,  s  s5   b6, and so on. Notice 
also that s lies between any two consecutive 
partial sums. 

A partial sum sn of any convergent series can be used as an approximation to the total sum 
s, but this is not of much use unless we can estimate the accuracy of the approximation. The 
error involved in using s  sn is the remainder Rn  s  sn. The next theorem says that for 
series that satisfy the conditions of the Alternating Series Test, the size of the error is 
smaller than bn1, which is the absolute value of the first neglected term.

series that satisfies

Definition A series  an is called conditionally convergent if it is convergent

it is possible for a series to be convergent but not absolutely convergent. However, the next 
theorem shows that absolute convergence implies convergence.

(i) The idea is to compare the given series with a convergent geometric series. Since

|||| ESTIMATING SUMS 

In the last three sections we used various methods 
for estimating the sum of a series—the 
method depended on which test was used to 
prove convergence. What about series for which 
the Ratio Test works? There are two possibilities: 
If the series happens to be an alternating series, 
as in Example 4, then it is best to use the methods 
of Section 11.5. If the terms are all positive, 
then use the special methods explained in 
Exercise 34. 

SECTION 11.6 ABSOLUTE CONVERGENCE AND THE RATIO AND ROOT TESTS .... 743 

is convergent because it is a geometric series with 0 r 1. So the inequality (5), 
together with the Comparison Test, shows that the series

nN1 k1 

is also convergent. It follows that the series  
n1  an  is convergent. (Recall that a finite 
number of terms doesn’t affect convergence.) Therefore,  an is absolutely convergent. 

(ii) If  an1an l L 
1 or  an1an l , then the ratio  an1an  will eventually be 
greater than 1; that is, there exists an integer N such that

an 

This means that  an1  
 an  whenever n 	N and so 

lim an  0 

n l  

Therefore,  an diverges by the Test for Divergence. 




NOTE Part (iii) of the Ratio Test says that if limn l   an1an   1, the test gives no

information. For instance, for the convergent series  1nwe have

Therefore, if limn l   an1an   1, the series  an might converge or it might diverge. In

SECTION 11.6 ABSOLUTE CONVERGENCE AND THE RATIO AND ROOT TESTS .... 745 

Rearrangements 

The question of whether a given convergent series is absolutely convergent or conditionally 
convergent has a bearing on the question of whether infinite sums behave like 
finite sums. 

If we rearrange the order of the terms in a finite sum, then of course the value of the 
sum remains unchanged. But this is not always the case for an infinite series. By a 
rearrangement of an infinite series  an we mean a series obtained by simply changing 
the order of the terms. For instance, a rearrangement of  an could start as follows: 

a1 a2 a5 a3 a4 a15 a6 a7 a20  

It turns out that 
if  an is an absolutely convergent series with sum s, 
then any rearrangement of  an has the same sum s. 

However, any conditionally convergent series can be rearranged to give a different sum. To 
illustrate this fact let’s consider the alternating harmonic series

1111111

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  ln 2 

(See Exercise 36 in Section 11.5.) If we multiply this series by 12 , we get 

1111 

2 4 6 8  12ln 2 

Inserting zeros between the terms of this series, we have

0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8  12 ln 2

of the series; each term in the sequence of par


tial sums is repeated, but the limit is the same. 

Now we add the series in Equations 6 and 7 using Theorem 11.2.8: 

8 
11111

1 3 2 5 7 4  32 ln 2 

Notice that the series in (8) contains the same terms as in (6), but rearranged so that one 
negative term occurs after each pair of positive terms. The sums of these series, however, 
are different. In fact, Riemann proved that 

if  an is a conditionally convergent series and r is any real number whatsoever, 
then there is a rearrangement of  an that has a sum equal to r. 

A proof of this fact is outlined in Exercise 40.

SECTION 11.7 STRATEGY FOR TESTING SERIES .... 747 

||||11.7 Strategy for Testing Series 

We now have several ways of testing a series for convergence or divergence; the problem 
is to decide which test to use on which series. In this respect testing series is similar to integrating 
functions. Again there are no hard and fast rules about which test to apply to a 
given series, but you may find the following advice of some use. 

It is not wise to apply a list of the tests in a specific order until one finally works. That 

would be a waste of time and effort. Instead, as with integration, the main strategy is to 

classify the series according to its form. 

p

1. If the series is of the form  1n, it is a p-series, which we know to be convergent 
if p 
 1 and divergent if p  1. 
n1 n

2. If the series has the form  aror  ar, it is a geometric series, which converges 
if  r   1 and diverges if  r  	 1. Some preliminary algebraic manipulation 
may be required to bring the series into this form. 
3. 
If the series has a form that is similar to a p-series or a geometric series, then 
one of the comparison tests should be considered. In particular, if an is a rational 
function or algebraic function of n (involving roots of polynomials), then the 
series should be compared with a p-series. Notice that most of the series in 
Exercises 11.4 have this form. (The value of p should be chosen as in Section 
11.4 by keeping only the highest powers of n in the numerator and denominator.) 
The comparison tests apply only to series with positive terms, but if  an 
has some negative terms, then we can apply the Comparison Test to  an  and 
test for absolute convergence. 
4. 
If you can see at a glance that limn l  an  0, then the Test for Divergence 
should be used. 
5. If the series is of the form 1n1bn or 1nbn, then the Alternating Series 
Test is an obvious possibility. 
6. 
Series that involve factorials or other products (including a constant raised to the 
nth power) are often conveniently tested using the Ratio Test. Bear in mind that 
 an1an l 1 as n l  for all p-series and therefore all rational or algebraic 
functions of n. Thus, the Ratio Test should not be used for such series. 
7. If an is of the form bn n, then the Root Test may be useful. 
x
x


8. If an  f n, where 1 f x dx is easily evaluated, then the Integral Test is effective 
(assuming the hypotheses of this test are satisfied). 
In the following examples we don’t work out all the details but simply indicate which 
tests should be used.

SECTION 11.8 POWER SERIES .... 749 

|||| 11.8 Power Series 

|||| TRIGONOMETRIC SERIES 

A power series is a series in which each term 
is a power function. A trigonometric series 

an cos nx bn sin nx 

n0 

is a series whose terms are trigonometric functions. 
This type of series is discussed on the 
web site 

www.stewartcalculus.com 

Click on Additional Topics and then on Fourier 
Series. 

A power series is a series of the form 

1 
 cnxn  c0 c1 x c2 x2 c3 x3  

n0 

where x is a variable and the cn ’s are constants called the coefficients of the series. For each 
fixed x, the series (1) is a series of constants that we can test for convergence or divergence. 
A power series may converge for some values of x and diverge for other values of x. The 
sum of the series is a function 

fx  c0 c1 x c2 x2 cnxn  

whose domain is the set of all x for which the series converges. Notice that f resembles a 
polynomial. The only difference is that f has infinitely many terms. 

For instance, if we take cn  1 for all n, the power series becomes the geometric series 

 xn  1 x x2 xn  

n0 

which converges when 1 x 1 and diverges when  x 	1 (see Equation 11.2.5). 
More generally, a series of the form 

2 
 cnx an  c0 c1x a c2x a2  

n0 

is called a power series in x a or a power series centered at a or a power series 
about a. Notice that in writing out the term corresponding to n  0 in Equations 1 and 2 
we have adopted the convention that x a0  1 even when x  a. Notice also that when 
x  a all of the terms are 0 for n 	1 and so the power series (2) always converges when 
x  a. 

n

EXAMPLE 1 For what values of x is the series  n!xconvergent?

750 .... CHAPTER 11 INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES 

By the Ratio Test, the given series is absolutely convergent, and therefore convergent, 
when 
 x  3 
  1 and divergent when 
 x  3 
  1. Now 


 x  3 
  1 &? 1  x  3  1 &? 2  x  4 

so the series converges when 2  x  4 and diverges when x  2 or x  4. 

The Ratio Test gives no information when 
 x  3 
  1 so we must consider x  2 

and x  4 separately. If we put x  4 in the series, it becomes 	 1n, the harmonic 

series, which is divergent. If x  2, the series is 	1nn, which converges by the 

Alternating Series Test. Thus, the given power series converges for 2  x  4. 

We will see that the main use of a power series is that it provides a way to represent 

some of the most important functions that arise in mathematics, physics, and chemistry. In 

particular, the sum of the power series in the next example is called a Bessel function, after 

the German astronomer Friedrich Bessel (1784–1846), and the function given in Exer


cise 33 is another example of a Bessel function. In fact, these functions first arose when 

Bessel solved Kepler’s equation for describing planetary motion. Since that time, these 

functions have been applied in many different physical situations, including the tempera


ture distribution in a circular plate and the shape of a vibrating drumhead (see the photo


graphs on page 700).

For the power series that we have looked at so far, the set of values of x for which the 
series is convergent has always turned out to be an interval [a finite interval for the 
geometric series and the series in Example 2, the infinite interval ,  in Example 3, 
and a collapsed interval 0, 0  0 in Example 1]. The following theorem, proved in 
Appendix F, says that this is true in general. 

Theorem For a given power series there are only three 
possibilities: 
(i) The series converges only when . 
(ii) The series converges for all . 
(iii) There is a positive number such that the series converges if 
and diverges if .

The number R in case (iii) is called the radius of convergence of the power series. By 
convention, the radius of convergence is R  0 in case (i) and R   in case (ii). The 
interval of convergence of a power series is the interval that consists of all values of x for 
which the series converges. In case (i) the interval consists of just a single point a. In case 

(ii) the interval is , . In case (iii) note that the inequality 
 x  a 
  R can be rewritten 
as a  R  x  a  R. When x is an endpoint of the interval, that is, x  a  R, 
anything can happen—the series might converge at one or both endpoints or it might 
diverge at both endpoints. Thus, in case (iii) there are four possibilities for the interval of 
convergence: 
a  R, a  Ra  R, a  Ra  R, a  Ra  R, a  R 

The situation is illustrated in Figure 3.

In general, the Ratio Test (or sometimes the Root Test) should be used to determine the 

radius of convergence R. The Ratio and Root Tests always fail when x is an endpoint of 

the interval of convergence, so the endpoints must be checked with some other test.

By the Ratio Test, the given series converges if 3

 x

Thus, it converges if 
 x 
 13 and diverges if 
 x 
 13. This means that the radius of 
convergence is R  13. 

We know the series converges in the interval (31, 31), but we must now test for 
convergence at the endpoints of this interval. If x  31, the series becomes

Using the Ratio Test, we see that the series converges if

 x 2 
 3 and diverges if

radius of convergence is R  3.

The inequality

ƒ=1-x and some partial sums 
In this section we learn how to represent certain types of functions as sums of power series 
by manipulating geometric series or by differentiating or integrating such a series. You 
might wonder why we would ever want to express a known function as a sum of infinitely 
many terms. We will see later that this strategy is useful for integrating functions that don’t 
have elementary antiderivatives, for solving differential equations, and for approximating 
functions by polynomials. (Scientists do this to simplify the expressions they deal with; 
computer scientists do this to represent functions on calculators and computers.) 

We start with an equation that we have seen before:

We first encountered this equation in Example 5 in Section 11.2, where we obtained it by 
observing that it is a geometric series with a  1 and r  x. But here our point of view is 
different. We now regard Equation 1 as expressing the function f x  11 x as a sum 
of a power series.

EXAMPLE 1 Express 11 x2  as the sum of a power series and find the interval of

Because this is a geometric series, it converges when 
 x2 
 1, that is, x2 1, or 

 x

determined the radius of convergence by applying the Ratio Test, but that much work is 
unnecessary here.) 

EXAMPLE 2 Find a power series representation for 1x 2.

EXAMPLE 3 Find a power series representation of x3x 2.

Differentiation and Integration of Power Series 

The sum of a power series is a function f x  	 
n0 cnx an whose domain is the interval 
of convergence of the series. We would like to be able to differentiate and integrate 
such functions, and the following theorem (which we won’t prove) says that we can do so 
by differentiating or integrating each individual term in the series, just as we would for a 
polynomial. This is called term-by-term differentiation and integration.

We know that, for finite sums, the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives and the 
integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals. Equations (iii) and (iv) assert that the same is 
true for infinite sums, provided we are dealing with power series. (For other types of series 
of functions the situation is not as simple; see Exercise 36.) 



NOTE 2 Although Theorem 2 says that the radius of convergence remains the same 
when a power series is differentiated or integrated, this does not mean that the interval of 
convergence remains the same. It may happen that the original series converges at an endpoint, 
whereas the differentiated series diverges there. (See Exercise 37.)

NOTE 3 The idea of differentiating a power series term by term is the basis for a powerful 
method for solving differential equations. We will discuss this method in Chapter 17.

Example 7 is called Gregory’s series after the

|||| This example demonstrates one way in 
which power series representations are useful. 
Integrating 11 x7  by hand is incredibly difficult. 
Different computer algebra systems return 
different forms of the answer, but they are all 
extremely complicated. (If you have a CAS, try it 
yourself.) The infinite series answer that we 
obtain in Example 8(a) is actually much easier to 
deal with than the finite answer provided by a 
CAS. 

SOLUTION 

(a) The first step is to express the integrand, 11 x7 , as the sum of a power series. 
As in Example 1, we start with Equation 1 and replace x by x7:

This series converges for 
 x
 1, that is, for 
 x
 1. 

(b) In applying the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus it doesn’t matter which antiderivative 
we use, so let’s use the antiderivative from part (a) with C  0:

This infinite series is the exact value of the definite integral, but since it is an alternating 
series, we can approximate the sum using the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem.

|||| 11.10 Taylor and Maclaurin Series 

In the preceding section we were able to find power series representations for a certain 
restricted class of functions. Here we investigate more general problems: Which functions 
have power series representations? How can we find such representations? 

We start by supposing that f is any function that can be represented by a power series 

1

f x  c0 c1 x a c2 x a2 c3 x a3 c4 x a4 			  x a R 
Let’s try to determine what the coefficients cn must be in terms of f. To begin, notice that 
if we put x  a in Equation 1, then all terms after the first one are 0 and we get 
fa  c0 

By Theorem 11.9.2, we can differentiate the series in Equation 1 term by term: 

f x  c1 2c2 x a 3c3 x a2 4c4 x a3 			  x a R 
and substitution of x  a in Equation 2 gives 
fa  c1 


3 
4 
SECTION 11.10 TAYLOR AND MACLAURIN SERIES .... 761 

Now we differentiate both sides of Equation 2 and obtain 

f x  2c2 2  3c3x a 3  4c4x a2 			  x a  R 

Again we put x  a in Equation 3. The result is 
f a  2c2 
Let’s apply the procedure one more time. Differentiation of the series in Equation 3 gives 

f 
x  2  3c3 2  3  4c4x a 3  4  5c5x a2 			  x a  R 

and substitution of x  a in Equation 4 gives 
f 
a  2  3c3  3!c3 
By now you can see the pattern. If we continue to differentiate and substitute x  a, we 
obtain 
f na  2  3  4  			  ncn  n!cn 
Solving this equation for the nth coefficient cn, we get 
f na 
cn  

n! 

This formula remains valid even for n  0 if we adopt the conventions that 0!  1 and 
f 0  f 

. Thus, we have proved the following theorem. 

5 
Theorem If f has a power series representation (expansion) at a, that is, if 
f x   cnx an  x a  R 

n0 

then its coefficients are given by the formula 

f na 

cn  

n! 

Substituting this formula for cn back into the series, we see that if f has a power series 
expansion at a, then it must be of the following form.

762 .... CHAPTER 11 INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES 

|||| The Taylor series is named after the English 
mathematician Brook Taylor (1685–1731) and the 
Maclaurin series is named in honor of the Scottish 
mathematician Colin Maclaurin (1698–1746) 
despite the fact that the Maclaurin series is 
really just a special case of the Taylor series. But 
the idea of representing particular functions as 
sums of power series goes back to Newton, and 
the general Taylor series was known to the Scottish 
mathematician James Gregory in 1668 and 
to the Swiss mathematician John Bernoulli in 
the 1690s. Taylor was apparently unaware of the 
work of Gregory and Bernoulli when he published 
his discoveries on series in 1715 in his book 
Methodus incrementorum directa et inversa. 
Maclaurin series are named after Colin Maclaurin 
because he popularized them in his calculus 
textbook Treatise of Fluxions published in 1742. 

The series in Equation 6 is called the Taylor series of the function f at a (or about a 
or centered at a). For the special case a  0 the Taylor series becomes

This case arises frequently enough that it is given the special name Maclaurin series.

NOTE We have shown that if f can be represented as a power series about a, then f is 
equal to the sum of its Taylor series. But there exist functions that are not equal to the sum 
of their Taylor series. An example of such a function is given in Exercise 62.

So how can we determine whether ex does have a power series representation?

is it true that

SECTION 11.10 TAYLOR AND MACLAURIN SERIES .... 763 

Notice that Tn is a polynomial of degree n called the nth-degree Taylor polynomial of f 

x

at a. For instance, for the exponential function f x  e, the result of Example 1 shows 
that the Taylor polynomials at 0 (or Maclaurin polynomials) with n  1, 2, and 3 are

In general, f x is the sum of its Taylor series if

If we let 

Rnx  f x  Tnx so that f x  Tnx  Rnx 

then Rnx is called the remainder of the Taylor series. If we can somehow show that 
limn l  Rnx  0, then it follows that 

lim Tnx  lim  f x  Rnx  f x  lim Rnx  f x 

n l  n l  n l  

We have therefore proved the following.

 x  a   R. 

In trying to show that limn l  Rnx  0 for a specific function f , we usually use the 
following fact.

To see why this is true for n  1, we assume that  f x  M. In particular, we have 
f x  M, so for a  x  a  d we have 

y xf t dt  y xM dt

This is called the integral form of the remainder

z between x and a such that

This version is an extension of the Mean Value 
Theorem (which is the case n  0).

of how to use them to solve the examples 
of Sections 11.10 and 11.12, are given on the

This proves Taylor’s Inequality for the case where n  1. The result for any n is proved 
in a similar way by integrating n 1 times. (See Exercise 61 for the case n  2.)

NOTE In Section 11.12 we will explore the use of Taylor’s Inequality in approximating 
functions. Our immediate use of it is in conjunction with Theorem 8. 

In applying Theorems 8 and 9 it is often helpful to make use of the following fact. 

xn 

lim  0 for every real number x 

n l  n!

10 
This is true because we know from Example 1 that the series 	 xnn! converges for all x 
and so its nth term approaches 0.

find the value of e correct to 23 digits. In 2000 
Xavier Gourdon and S. Kondo, again using the

billion decimal places. The special techniques 
they employed to speed up the computation are

We have two power series expansions for ex, the Maclaurin series in Equation 11 and 
the Taylor series in Equation 13. The first is better if we are interested in values of x near 
0 and the second is better if x is near 2. 

EXAMPLE 4 Find the Maclaurin series for sin x and prove that it represents sin x for all x. 
SOLUTION We arrange our computation in two columns as follows:

f x  sin xf 0  0

FIGURE 2 

|||| The Maclaurin series for ex , sin x, and cos x 
that we found in Examples 2, 4, and 5 were discovered, 
using different methods, by Newton. 
(There is evidence that the series for sin x and 
cos x were known to Indian astronomers more 
than a century before Newton, but this knowledge 
didn’t spread to the rest of the world.) 

These equations are remarkable because they 
say we know everything about each of these 
functions if we know all its derivatives at the 
single number 0. 

Since f n1x is sin x or cos x, we know that  f n1x 1 for all x. So we can 
take M  1 in Taylor’s Inequality:

14 
Mn1  x 

 Rnx   x 

n 1! n 1! 

By Equation 10 the right side of this inequality approaches 0 as n l , so 
 Rnxl 0 by the Squeeze Theorem. It follows that Rnx l 0 as n l , so sin x 
is equal to the sum of its Maclaurin series by Theorem 8. 

We state the result of Example 4 for future reference. 

EXAMPLE 5 Find the Maclaurin series for cos x. 

SOLUTION We could proceed directly as in Example 4 but it’s easier to differentiate the 
Maclaurin series for sin x given by Equation 15:

us that the differentiated series for cos x also converges for all x. Thus

768 .... CHAPTER 11 INFINITE SEQUENCES AND SERIES 


Module 11.10/11.12 enables you to see One reason that Taylor series are important is that they enable us to integrate functions 
how successive Taylor polynomials 

that we couldn’t previously handle. In fact, in the introduction to this chapter we men


approach the original function. 

tioned that Newton often integrated functions by first expressing them as power series and 
then integrating the series term by term. The function f x  ex 2 can’t be integrated by 
techniques discussed so far because its antiderivative is not an elementary function (see 
Section 7.5). In the following example we use Newton’s idea to integrate this function.

(a) Evaluate x ex 2 dx as an infinite series.

(b) Evaluate 0 ex dx correct to within an error of 0.001. 
SOLUTION 

(a) First we find the Maclaurin series for f x  ex 2. Although it’s possible to use the 
direct method, let’s find it simply by replacing x with x2 in the series for ex given in 
the table of Maclaurin series. Thus, for all values of x,

Multiplication and Division of Power Series 

If power series are added or subtracted, they behave like polynomials (Theorem 11.2.8 
shows this). In fact, as the following example illustrates, they can also be multiplied and 
divided like polynomials. We find only the first few terms because the calculations for the 
later terms become tedious and the initial terms are the most important ones. 

EXAMPLE 10 Find the first three nonzero terms in the Maclaurin series for (a) ex sin x and 

(b) tan x.

One of Newton’s accomplishments was to extend the Binomial Theorem (Equation 1) to 
the case in which k is no longer a positive integer. (See the Writing Project on page 776.) 
In this case the expression for 1 xk is no longer a finite sum; it becomes an infinite 
series. To find this series we compute the Maclaurin series of 1 xk in the usual way: 

fx  1 xk

Thus, by the Ratio Test, the binomial series converges if  x 1 and diverges if  x 1. 

The following theorem states that 1 xk is equal to the sum of its Maclaurin series. 
It is possible to prove this by showing that the remainder term Rnx approaches 0, but that 
turns out to be quite difficult. The proof outlined in Exercise 19 is much easier.

Although the binomial series always converges when  x  1, the question of whether 
or not it converges at the endpoints, 1, depends on the value of k. It turns out that the 
series converges at 1 if 1 k 	0 and at both endpoints if k 0. Notice that if k is a 
positive integer and n k, then the expression for ( k ) contains a factor k k, so ( k ) 0

nn 
for n k. This means that the series terminates and reduces to the ordinary Binomial 
Theorem (Equation 1) when k is a positive integer. 
As we have seen, the binomial series is just a special case of the Maclaurin series; it 
occurs so frequently that it is worth remembering.

How Newton Discovered the Binomial Series 

The Binomial Theorem, which gives the expansion of a  bk, was known to Chinese mathematicians 
many centuries before the time of Newton for the case where the exponent k is a 
positive integer. In 1665, when he was 22, Newton was the first to discover the infinite series 
expansion of a  bk when k is a fractional exponent (positive or negative). He didn’t publish 
his discovery, but he stated it and gave examples of how to use it in a letter (now called the 
epistola prior) dated June 13, 1676, that he sent to Henry Oldenburg, secretary of the Royal 
Society of London, to transmit to Leibniz. When Leibniz replied, he asked how Newton had 
discovered the binomial series. Newton wrote a second letter, the epistola posterior of October 
24, 1676, in which he explained in great detail how he arrived at his discovery by a very indirect 

2 n2

route. He was investigating the areas under the curves y  1  xfrom 0 to x forn  0 ,1,2, 
3, 4,.... These are easy to calculate if n is even. By observing patterns and interpolating, Newton 
was able to guess the answers for odd values of n. Then he realized he could get the same 

2 n2

answers by expressing 1  x as an infinite series. 

Write a report on Newton’s discovery of the binomial series. Start by giving the statement of 
the binomial series in Newton’s notation (see the epistola prior on page 285 of [4] or page 402 
of [2]). Explain why Newton’s version is equivalent to Theorem 2 on page 773. Then read Newton’s 
epistola posterior (page 287 in [4] or page 404 in [2]) and explain the patterns that Newton 

2 n2

discovered in the areas under the curves y  1  x. Show how he was able to guess the 
areas under the remaining curves and how he verified his answers. Finally, explain how these 
discoveries led to the binomial series. The books by Edwards [1] and Katz [3] contain commentaries 
on Newton’s letters.

|||| 11.12 Applications of Taylor Polynomials 

In this section we explore two types of applications of Taylor polynomials. First we look 
at how they are used to approximate functions––computer scientists like them because 
polynomials are the simplest of functions. Then we investigate how physicists and engineers 
use them in such fields as relativity, optics, blackbody radiation, electric dipoles, the 
velocity of water waves, and building highways across a desert.

SECTION 11.12 APPLICATIONS OF TAYLOR POLYNOMIALS .... 777 

In Section 11.10 we introduced the notation Tnx for the nth partial sum of this series and 
called it the nth-degree Taylor polynomial of f at a. Thus 

n 

f ia. 
Tnx 

i0 i!

 f a  x a  x a2  x an 

1! 2! 
n! 

Since f is the sum of its Taylor series, we know that Tnx l f x as n l and so Tn can 
be used as an approximation to f : f x Tnx. 

Notice that the first-degree Taylor polynomial 

T1x  f a f ax a 

is the same as the linearization of f at a that we discussed in Section 3.11. Notice also that 
T1 and its derivative have the same values at a that f and f have. In general, it can be 
shown that the derivatives of Tn at a agree with those of f up to and including derivatives 
of order n (see Exercise 36). 

To illustrate these ideas let’s take another look at the graphs of y  ex and its first few 
Taylor polynomials, as shown in Figure 1. The graph of T1 is the tangent line to y  ex 

x

at 0, 1; this tangent line is the best linear approximation to enear 0, 1. The graph 
of T2 is the parabola y  1 x x22, and the graph of T3 is the cubic curve 

x

y  1 x x22 x36, which is a closer fit to the exponential curve y  ethan T2. 
The next Taylor polynomial T4 would be an even better approximation, and so on. 

The values in the table give a numerical demonstration of the convergence of the Taylor 

x

polynomials Tnx to the function y  e. We see that when x  0.2 the convergence is 
very rapid, but when x  3 it is somewhat slower. In fact, the farther x is from 0, the more 

x

slowly Tnx converges to e. 

When using a Taylor polynomial Tn to approximate a function f , we have to ask the 
questions: How good an approximation is it? How large should we take n to be in order to 
achieve a desired accuracy? To answer these questions we need to look at the absolute 
value of the remainder: 

 Rnx   f x Tnx 

There are three possible methods for estimating the size of the error: 

1. 
If a graphing device is available, we can use it to graph  Rnx and thereby estimate 
the error. 
2. 
If the series happens to be an alternating series, we can use the Alternating Series 
Estimation Theorem. 
3. 
In all cases we can use Taylor’s Inequality (Theorem 11.10.9), which says that if 
f n1x

 	M, then 

 Rnx

(b) The Taylor series is not alternating when x  8, so we can’t use the Alternating 
Series Estimation Theorem in this example. But we can use Taylor’s Inequality with 
n  2 and a  8:

Therefore, we can take M  0.0021. Also 7 	 x 	 9, so 1 	 x  8 	 1 and 
 x  8  	 1. Then Taylor’s Inequality gives 
0.0021 0.0021 

R2x 	  13   0.0004

Thus, if 7 	 x 	 9, the approximation in part (a) is accurate to within 0.0004.

Let’s use a graphing device to check the calculation in Example 1. Figure 2 shows that 

3

the graphs of y  sx and y  T2x are very close to each other when x is near 8. Figure

We see from the graph that

when 7 	 x 	 9. Thus, the error estimate from graphical methods is slightly better than 
the error estimate from Taylor’s Inequality in this case.

(b) For what values of x is this approximation accurate to within 0.00005?

(a) Notice that the Maclaurin series

sin x  x    

is alternating for all nonzero values of x, and the successive terms decrease in size 
because  x  1, so we can use the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem. The error in 
approximating sin x by the first three terms of its Maclaurin series is at most

(b) The error will be smaller than 0.00005 if

Solving this inequality for x, we get

So the given approximation is accurate to within 0.00005 when  x  0.82.

One use of the type of calculation done in Examples 1 and 2 occurs in calculators and 
computers. For instance, when you press the sin or ex key on your calculator, or when a 
computer programmer uses a subroutine for a trigonometric or exponential or Bessel function, 
in many machines a polynomial approximation is calculated. The polynomial is often 
a Taylor polynomial that has been modified so that the error is spread more evenly throughout 
an interval. 

Applications to Physics 

Taylor polynomials are also used frequently in physics. In order to gain insight into an 
equation, a physicist often simplifies a function by considering only the first two or three 
terms in its Taylor series. In other words, the physicist uses a Taylor polynomial as an 
approximation to the function. Taylor’s Inequality can then be used to gauge the accuracy 
of the approximation. The following example shows one way in which this idea is used in 
special relativity.

velocity v is

practically identical.

(a) Show that when v is very small compared with c, this expression for K agrees with 
classical Newtonian physics: K  12 m0v2. 
(b) Use Taylor’s Inequality to estimate the difference in these expressions for K when 
 v  100 ms.

Another application to physics occurs in optics. Figure 8 is adapted from Optics, 
4th ed., by Eugene Hecht (Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 2002), page 153. It depicts a 

wave from the point source S meeting a spherical interface of radius R centered at C. The 
ray SA is refracted toward P. 
Using Fermat’s principle that light travels so as to minimize the time taken, Hecht 
derives the equation

Because Equation 1 is cumbersome to work with, Gauss, in 1841, simplified it by using 

the linear approximation 

cos

for small values of 

. (This amounts to using the 
Taylor polynomial of degree 1.) Then Equation 1 becomes the following simpler equation

The resulting optical theory is known as Gaussian optics, or first-order optics, and has 
become the basic theoretical tool used to design lenses. 

A more accurate theory is obtained by approximating 

cos 

by its Taylor polynomial of 

degree 3 (which is the same as the Taylor polynomial of degree 2). This takes into account 

rays for which 

is not so small, that is, rays that strike the surface at greater distances h 

above the axis. In Exercise 32(b) you are asked to use this approximation to derive the 
more accurate equation

APPLIED PROJECT RADIATION FROM THE STARS .... 785 

APPLIED PROJECT 

Radiation from the Stars 

Any object emits radiation when heated. A blackbody is a system that absorbs all the radiation 
that falls on it. For instance, a matte black surface or a large cavity with a small hole in its wall 
(like a blastfurnace) is a blackbody and emits blackbody radiation. Even the radiation from the 
Sun is close to being blackbody radiation. 

Proposed in the late 19th century, the Rayleigh-Jeans Law expresses the energy density of 


as

blackbody radiation of wavelength 

f   

8kT 

4 

where 

is measured in meters, T is the temperature in kelvins (K), and k is Boltzmann’s con


stant. The Rayleigh-Jeans Law agrees with experimental measurements for long wavelengths but 

disagrees drastically for short wavelengths. [The law predicts that 

f  l  

as 

l 0 

but 

experiments have shown that 

f  l 0

.] This fact is known as the ultraviolet catastrophe. 

In 1900 Max Planck found a better model (known now as Planck’s Law) for blackbody 
radiation: 

8hc

5 

f   

hckT   1

where 

is measured in meters, T is the temperature (in kelvins), and 
h  Planck’s constant  6.6262  1034 J
s 
c  speed of light  2.997925  108 ms 
k  Boltzmann’s constant  1.3807  1023 JK 

1. Use l’Hospital’s Rule to show that 
lim 

l 0 

f   0 

f   0

and lim 

l  

for Planck’s Law. So this law models blackbody radiation better than the Rayleigh-Jeans 
Law for short wavelengths. 

2. 
Use a Taylor polynomial to show that, for large wavelengths, Planck’s Law gives approximately 
the same values as the Rayleigh-Jeans Law. 
; 3. Graph f as given by both laws on the same screen and comment on the similarities and 
differences. Use T  5700 K (the temperature of the Sun). (You may want to change from 
meters to the more convenient unit of micrometers: 1 m  106 m.) 

4. Use your graph in Problem 3 to estimate the value of 
for which 

f  

is a maximum under 

Planck’s Law. 

; 5. 
Investigate how the graph of f changes as T varies. (Use Planck’s Law.) In particular, graph 
f for the stars Betelgeuse (T  3400 K), Procyon ( T  6400 K), and Sirius (T  9200 K) as 
well as the Sun. How does the total radiation emitted (the area under the curve) vary with T ? 
Use the graph to comment on why Sirius is known as a blue star and Betelgeuse as a red 
star.

In this chapter we introduce vectors and coordinate systems for 
three-dimensional space. This will be the setting for our study of 
the calculus of functions of two variables in Chapter 14 because 

the graph of such a function is a surface in space. In this chapter 
we will see that vectors provide particularly simple descriptions 
of lines and planes in space. 

|||| 12.1 Three-Dimensional Coordinate Systems 

To locate a point in a plane, two numbers are necessary. We know that any point in 
the plane can be represented as an ordered pair of real numbers, where is theaa, b 
-coordinate and is the -coordinate. For this reason, a plane is called two-dimensional. ybx 
To locate a point in space, three numbers are required. We represent any point in space by 
an ordered triple of real numbers.a, b, c 
In order to represent points in space, we first choose a fixed point (the origin) andO 
three directed lines through that are perpendicular to each other, called the coordinateO 
axes and labeled the -axis, -axis, and -axis. Usually we think of the - and -axes as yxzyx 
FIGURE 1 being horizontal and the -axis as being vertical, and we draw the orientation of the axes z 
Coordinate axes as in Figure 1. The direction of the -axis is determined by the right-hand rule as illusz 
trated in Figure 2: If you curl the fingers of your right hand around the -axis in the direcz

tion of a 90 counterclockwise rotation from the positive x-axis to the positive y-axis, then 
your thumb points in the positive direction of the z-axis. 

The three coordinate axes determine the three coordinate planes illustrated in Figure 
3(a). The xy-plane is the plane that contains the x- and y-axes; the yz-plane contains 
the y- and z-axes; the xz-plane contains the x- and z-axes. These three coordinate planes 
divide space into eight parts, called octants. The first octant, in the foreground, is deter


y mined by the positive axes.

Because many people have some difficulty visualizing diagrams of three-dimensional 
figures, you may find it helpful to do the following [see Figure 3(b)]. Look at any bottom 
corner of a room and call the corner the origin. The wall on your left is in the xz-plane, the 
wall on your right is in the yz-plane, and the floor is in the xy-plane. The x-axis runs along 
the intersection of the floor and the left wall. The y-axis runs along the intersection of the 
floor and the right wall. The z-axis runs up from the floor toward the ceiling along the intersection 
of the two walls. You are situated in the first octant, and you can now imagine seven 
other rooms situated in the other seven octants (three on the same floor and four on the 
floor below), all connected by the common corner point O.

Now if P is any point in space, let a be the (directed) distance from the yz-plane to P, 
let b be the distance from the xz-plane to P, and let c be the distance from the xy-plane to 

P. We represent the point P by the ordered triple a, b, c of real numbers and we call a, b, 
and c the coordinates of P; a is the x-coordinate, b is the y-coordinate, and c is the 
z-coordinate. Thus, to locate the point a, b, c we can start at the origin O and move 
a units along the x-axis, then b units parallel to the y-axis, and then c units parallel to the 
z-axis as in Figure 4. 
The point Pa, b, c determines a rectangular box as in Figure 5. If we drop a perpendicular 
from P to the xy-plane, we get a point Q with coordinates a, b, 0 called the pro-

FIGURE 4 

jection of P on the xy-plane. Similarly, R0, b, c and Sa, 0, c are the projections of P on 

the yz-plane and xz-plane, respectively. 

As numerical illustrations, the points 4, 3, 5 and 3, 2, 6 are plotted in

The Cartesian product       x, y, z x, y, z   is the set of all ordered 
triples of real numbers and is denoted by 3. We have given a one-to-one correspondence 
between points P in space and ordered triples a, b, c in 3. It is called a threedimensional 
rectangular coordinate system. Notice that, in terms of coordinates, the 
first octant can be described as the set of points whose coordinates are all positive. 

In two-dimensional analytic geometry, the graph of an equation involving x and y is a 

curve in 2. In three-dimensional analytic geometry, an equation in x, y, and z represents 

a surface in 3. 

EXAMPLE 1 What surfaces in 3 are represented by the following equations? 

(a) z  3 (b) y  5 
SOLUTION 

(a) The equation z  3 represents the set x, y, z z  3, which is the set of all points 
in 3 whose z-coordinate is 3. This is the horizontal plane that is parallel to the xy-plane 
and three units above it as in Figure 7(a).

(b) The equation y  5 represents the set of all points in 3 whose y-coordinate is 5. 
This is the vertical plane that is parallel to the xz-plane and five units to the right of it as 
in Figure 7(b). 


NOTE When an equation is given, we must understand from the context whether it represents 
a curve in 2 or a surface in 3. In Example 1, y  5 represents a plane in 3, but 
of course y  5 can also represent a line in 2 if we are dealing with two-dimensional analytic 
geometry. See Figure 7(b) and (c). 

In general, if k is a constant, then x  k represents a plane parallel to the yz-plane, 
y  k is a plane parallel to the xz-plane, and z  k is a plane parallel to the xy-plane. In 
Figure 5, the faces of the rectangular box are formed by the three coordinate planes x  0 
(the yz-plane), y  0 (the xz-plane), and z  0 (the xy-plane), and the planes x  a, y  b, 
and z  c. 

EXAMPLE 2 Describe and sketch the surface in 3 represented by the equation y  x. 

SOLUTION The equation represents the set of all points in 3 whose x- and y-coordinates 
are equal, that is, x, x, z x  , z  . This is a vertical plane that intersects the 
xy-plane in the line y  x, z  0. The portion of this plane that lies in the first octant is 
sketched in Figure 8. 


The familiar formula for the distance between two points in a plane is easily extended 
to the following three-dimensional formula. 

Distance Formula in Three Dimensions The distance  P1P2  between the points 
P1x1, y1, z1 and P2x2, y2, z2  is 

 P1P2   sx2  x12  y2  y12  z2  z12 

z 


To see why this formula is true, we construct a rectangular box as in Figure 9, where P1 
0 
A(¤,›,z¡) 
P™(¤, fi, z™) 
B(¤,fi,z¡) 
P¡(/,›,z¡) and P2 are opposite vertices and the faces of the box are parallel to the coordinate planes. 
If Ax2, y1, z1 and Bx2, y2, z1 are the vertices of the box indicated in the figure, then 

 P1A    x2  x1  AB    y2  y1  BP2    z2  z1  

Because triangles P1BP2 and P1AB are both right-angled, two applications of the Pythagorean 
Theorem give

Combining these equations, we get

Therefore  P1P2   sx2  x12  y2  y12  z2  z12

EXAMPLE 4 Find an equation of a sphere with radius r and center Ch, k, l. 


SOLUTION By definition, a sphere is the set of all points Px, y, z whose distance from 
C is r. (See Figure 10.) Thus, P is on the sphere if and only if  PC   r. Squaring both 
sides, we have  PC 2  r2 or 

x  h2  y  k2  z  l2  r2 

The result of Example 4 is worth remembering. 

Equation of a Sphere An equation of a sphere with center Ch, k, l and radius r is 
x  h2  y  k2  z  l2  r2 

FIGURE 10 

In particular, if the center is the origin O, then an equation of the sphere is 

x2  y2  z2  r2 

EXAMPLE 5 Show that x2  y2  z2  4x  6y  2z  6  0 is the equation of a 
sphere, and find its center and radius. 

SOLUTION We can rewrite the given equation in the form of an equation of a sphere if we 
complete squares: 

x2  4x  4  y2  6y  9  z2  2z  1  6  4  9  1 

x  22  y  32  z  12  8 

Comparing this equation with the standard form, we see that it is the equation of a 
sphere with center 2, 3, 1 and radius s8  2s2.

EXAMPLE 6 What region in is represented by the following inequalities? 

1  x2  y2  z2  4 z  0 

SOLUTION The inequalities 

1  x2  y2  z2  4 

can be rewritten as 

1  sx2  y2  z2  2 

so they represent the points x, y, zwhose distance from the origin is at least 1 and at 
most 2. But we are also given that z  0, so the points lie on or below the xy-plane. 
Thus, the given inequalities represent the region that lies between (or on) the spheres 
x2  y2  z2  1 and x2  y2  z2  4 and beneath (or on) the xy-plane. It is sketched

Equivalent vectors 

The term vector is used by scientists to indicate a quantity (such as displacement or velocity 
or force) that has both magnitude and direction. A vector is often represented by an 
arrow or a directed line segment. The length of the arrow represents the magnitude of the 
vector and the arrow points in the direction of the vector. We denote a vector by printing a 
letter in boldface v or by putting an arrow above the letter vl. 

For instance, suppose a particle moves along a line segment from point A to point B. 
The corresponding displacement vector v, shown in Figure 1, has initial point A (the tail)

l

and terminal point B (the tip) and we indicate this by writing v  AB. Notice that the vec


l 

tor u  CDhas the same length and the same direction as v even though it is in a different 
position. We say that u and v are equivalent (or equal) and we write u  v. The zero 
vector, denoted by 0, has length 0. It is the only vector with no specific direction.

FIGURE 2

Suppose a particle moves from A to B, so its displacement vector is AB. Then the particle 

l

changes direction and moves from B to C, with displacement vector BCas in Figure 2. The 
combined effect of these displacements is that the particle has moved from A to C. The 

l 
ll

resulting displacement vector ACis called the sum of ABand BCand we write 

l ll

In general, if we start with vectors u and v, we first move v so that its tail coincides with 
the tip of u and define the sum of u and v as follows. 

Definition of Vector Addition If u and v are vectors positioned so the initial point of v 
is at the terminal point of u, then the sum u  v is the vector from the initial point 
of u to the terminal point of v.

In Figure 4 we start with the same vectors u and v as in Figure 3 and draw another 
copy of v with the same initial point as u. Completing the parallelogram, we see that 
u  v  v  u. This also gives another way to construct the sum: If we place u and v so 
they start at the same point, then u  v lies along the diagonal of the parallelogram with 
u and v as sides. (This is called the Parallelogram Law.) 

EXAMPLE 1 Draw the sum of the vectors a and b shown in Figure 5. 

SOLUTION First we translate b and place its tail at the tip of a, being careful to draw a copy 
of b that has the same length and direction. Then we draw the vector a  b [see Figure 
6(a)] starting at the initial point of a and ending at the terminal point of the copy of b. 

Alternatively, we could place b so it starts where a starts and construct a  b by the 
Parallelogram Law as in Figure 6(b).

It is possible to multiply a vector by a real number c. (In this context we call the real 
number c a scalar to distinguish it from a vector.) For instance, we want 2v to be the same 
vector as v  v, which has the same direction as v but is twice as long. In general, we multiply 
a vector by a scalar as follows. 

Definition of Scalar Multiplication If c is a scalar and v is a vector, then the scalar multiple 
cv is the vector whose length is  c  times the length of v and whose direction 
is the same as v if c  0 and is opposite to v if c  0. If c  0 or v  0, then 
cv  0. 

This definition is illustrated in Figure 7. We see that real numbers work like scaling factors 
here; that’s why we call them scalars. Notice that two nonzero vectors are parallel if 
they are scalar multiples of one another. In particular, the vector v  1v has the same 
length as v but points in the opposite direction. We call it the negative of .

v 
By the difference u  v of two vectors we mean 


u  v  u  v

So we can construct u  v by first drawing the negative of v, v, and then adding it to u 
by the Parallelogram Law as in Figure 8(a). Alternatively, since v  u  v  u, the vector 
u  v, when added to v, gives u. So we could construct u  v as in Figure 8(b) by 
means of the Triangle Law.

a  2b as in Figure 10.

For some purposes it’s best to introduce a coordinate system and treat vectors algebraically. 
If we place the initial point of a vector a at the origin of a rectangular coordinate 
system, then the terminal point of a has coordinates of the form a1, a2 or a1, a2, a3, 
depending on whether our coordinate system is two- or three-dimensional (see Figure 11). 
These coordinates are called the components of a and we write 

a  	a1, a2 
 or a  	a1, a2, a3 
 

We use the notation 	a1, a2 
 for the ordered pair that refers to a vector so as not to confuse 
it with the ordered pair a1, a2 that refers to a point in the plane. 

For instance, the vectors shown in Figure 12 are all equivalent to the vector 

l

OP 	3, 2
 whose terminal point is P3, 2. What they have in common is that the terminal 
point is reached from the initial point by a displacement of three units to the right 
and two upward. We can think of all these geometric vectors as representations of the

In three dimensions, the vector a  OP 	a1, a2, a3

the initial point is Ax1, y1, z1 and the terminal point is Bx2, y2, z2 . Then we must have 
x1  a1  x2, y1  a2  y2, and z1  a3  z2 and so a1  x2  x1, a2  y2  y1, and 
a3  z2  z1. Thus, we have the following result.

The magnitude or length of the vector v is the length of any of its representations and 
is denoted by the symbol  v  or  v . By using the distance formula to compute the length 
of a segment OP, we obtain the following formulas.

 is 
 a   sa21  a2

The length of the three-dimensional vector a  	a1, a2, a3

How do we add vectors algebraically? Figure 14 shows that if a  	a1, a2 
 and 
b  	b1, b2 
, then the sum is a  b  	a1  b1, a2  b2 
, at least for the case where the 
components are positive. In other words, to add algebraic vectors we add their components. 
Similarly, to subtract vectors we subtract components. From the similar triangles in 
Figure 15 we see that the components of ca are ca1 and ca2. So to multiply a vector by a 
scalar we multiply each component by that scalar. 

If a  	a1, a2 
 and b  	b1, b2 
, then 
a  b  	a1  b1, a2  b2 
 a  b  	a1  b1, a2  b2

We denote by V2 the set of all two-dimensional vectors and by V3 the set of all threedimensional 
vectors. More generally, we will later need to consider the set Vn of all 
n-dimensional vectors. An n-dimensional vector is an ordered n-tuple: 

a  a1, a2,..., an  

where a1, a2,..., an are real numbers that are called the components of a. Addition and 
scalar multiplication are defined in terms of components just as for the cases n  2 and 
n  3. 

Properties of Vectors If a, b, and c are vectors in Vn and c and d are scalars, then 

1. a  b  b  a 2. a  b  c  a  b  c 
3. a  0  a 4. a  a  0 
5. ca  b  ca  cb 6. c  da  ca  da 
7. cda  cda 8. 1a  a 
These eight properties of vectors can be readily verified either geometrically or algebraically. 
For instance, Property 1 can be seen from Figure 4 (it’s equivalent to the Parallelogram 
Law) or as follows for the case n  2: 

a  b  a1, a2   b1, b2   a1  b1, a2  b2  

 b1  a1, b2  a2   b1, b2   a1, a2  

 b  a 

We can see why Property 2 (the associative law) is true by looking at Figure 16 and 

l

applying the Triangle Law several times: The vector PQis obtained either by first constructing 
a  b and then adding c or by adding a to the vector b  c.

i  1, 0, 0 j  0, 1, 0 k  0, 0, 1

Then i , j, and k are vectors that have length 1 and point in the directions of the positive 
x-, y-, and z-axes. Similarly, in two dimensions we define i  1, 0 and j  0, 1. (See

Applications 

Vectors are useful in many aspects of physics and engineering. In Chapter 13 we will see 
how they describe the velocity and acceleration of objects moving in space. Here we look 
at forces. 
A force is represented by a vector because it has both a magnitude (measured in pounds 
or newtons) and a direction. If several forces are acting on an object, the resultant force 
experienced by the object is the vector sum of these forces.

The resultant of the tensions counterbalances the weight and so we must have wT1 T2

Velocities have both direction and magnitude and thus are

Suppose that a wind is blowing from the direction N 45W at a 
speed of 50 kmh. (This means that the direction from which 
the wind blows is 45 west of the northerly direction.) A pilot

in still air) of 250 kmh. The true course, or track, of the plane 
is the direction of the resultant of the velocity vectors of the 
plane and the wind. The ground speed of the plane is the magnitude 
of the resultant. Find the true course and the ground 
speed of the plane.

SECTION 12.3 THE DOT PRODUCT .... 807 

|||| 12.3 
The Dot Product 

So far we have added two vectors and multiplied a vector by a scalar. The question arises: 
Is it possible to multiply two vectors so that their product is a useful quantity? One such 
product is the dot product, whose definition follows. Another is the cross product, which 
is discussed in the next section. 

1 
Definition If a  a1, a2, a3  and b  b1, b2, b3 , then the dot product of a 

and b is the number a  b given by 

a  b  a1b1  a2b2  a3b3 

Thus, to find the dot product of a and b we multiply corresponding components and 
add. The result is not a vector. It is a real number, that is, a scalar. For this reason, the dot 
product is sometimes called the scalar product (or inner product). Although Definition 1 
is given for three-dimensional vectors, the dot product of two-dimensional vectors is 
defined in a similar fashion: 

a1, a2   b1, b2   a1b1  a2b2 

EXAMPLE 1

i  2 j  3k  2 j  k  10  22  31  7 

The dot product obeys many of the laws that hold for ordinary products of real numbers. 
These are stated in the following theorem.

Properties of the Dot Product If a, b, and c are vectors in V3 and c is a scalar, then

These properties are easily proved using Definition 1. For instance, here are the proofs 
of Properties 1 and 3:

 a1b1  a2b2  a3b3  a1c1  a2c2  a3c3 . 
 a  b  a  c 
The proofs of the remaining properties are left as exercises. 

The dot product a  b can be given a geometric interpretation in terms of the angle 

between a and b, which is defined to be the angle between the representations of a and 

b that start at the origin, where 0  

. In other words, 
is the angle between the

Using Properties 1, 2, and 3 of the dot product, we can rewrite the left side of this equation 
as follows:

One use of projections occurs in physics in calculating work. In Section 6.4 we defined 
the work done by a constant force F in moving an object through a distance d as W  Fd, 
but this applies only when the force is directed along the line of motion of the object.

Suppose, however, that the constant force is a vector F  PRpointing in some other direction 
as in Figure 6. If the force moves the object from P to Q, then the displacement

vector is D  PQ. The work done by this force is defined to be the product of the component

The cross product a  b of two vectors a and b, unlike the dot product, is a vector. For 
this reason it is also called the vector product. Note that a  b is defined only when a and 
b are three-dimensional vectors. 

and 
1 
Definition If a  a1, a2, a3  and b  b1, b2, b3 , then the cross product of a 
b is the vector 

a  b  a2b3  a3b2, a3b1  a1b3, a1b2  a2b1  

This may seem like a strange way of defining a product. The reason for the particular 
form of Definition 1 is that the cross product defined in this way has many useful properties, 
as we will soon see. In particular, we will show that the vector a  b is perpendicular 
to both a and b. 

In order to make Definition 1 easier to remember, we use the notation of determinants. 
A determinant of order 2 is defined by

follows:

SECTION 12.4 THE CROSS PRODUCT .... 815 

Observe that each term on the right side of Equation 2 involves a number ai in the first row 
of the determinant, and ai is multiplied by the second-order determinant obtained from the 
left side by deleting the row and column in which ai appears. Notice also the minus sign 
in the second term. For example,

If we now rewrite Definition 1 using second-order determinants and the standard basis 
vectors i , j, and k, we see that the cross product of the vectors a  a1 i  a2 j  a3 k and 
b  b1 i  b2 j  b3 k is

In view of the similarity between Equations 2 and 3, we often write 

i jk 
a  b  a1 a2 a3

Although the first row of the symbolic determinant in Equation 4 consists of vectors, if we 
expand it as if it were an ordinary determinant using the rule in Equation 2, we obtain 
Equation 3. The symbolic formula in Equation 4 is probably the easiest way of remembering 
and computing cross products.

One of the most important properties of the cross product is given by the following 
theorem. 

5 
Theorem The vector a  b is orthogonal to both a and b. 

Proof In order to show that a  b is orthogonal to a, we compute their dot product as 
follows: 

a2 a3 a1 a3 a1 a2

a  b  a  a1  a2  a3

b2 b3 b1 b3 b1 b2 

 a1a2b3  a3b2   a2a1b3  a3b1  a3a1b2  a2b1 

 a1a2b3  a1b2a3  a1a2b3  b1a2a3  a1b2a3  b1a2a3 

 0 

A similar computation shows that a  b  b  0. Therefore, a  b is orthogonal to 
both a and b. 


If a and b are represented by directed line segments with the same initial point (as in 

Figure 1), then Theorem 5 says that the cross product a  b points in a direction perpen


dicular to the plane through a and b. It turns out that the direction of a  b is given by the 

axb 

right-hand rule: If the fingers of your right hand curl in the direction of a rotation (through 
an angle less than 180) from a to b, then your thumb points in the direction of a  b. 
Now that we know the direction of the vector a  b, the remaining thing we need to 
ab complete its geometric description is its length a  b . This is given by the following

theorem.

The geometric interpretation of Theorem 6 can be seen by looking at Figure 2. If a and

Thus, we have the following way of interpreting the magnitude of a cross product. 

FIGURE 2 

The length of the cross product a  b is equal to the area of the parallelogram 
determined by a and b.

SOLUTION The vector PQ PRis perpendicular to both PQand PRand is therefore perpendicular 
to the plane through P, Q, and R. We know from (12.2.1) that

 5  35i  15  0j  15  0k  40 i  15 j  15k 

So the vector 40, 15, 15 is perpendicular to the given plane. Any nonzero scalar 
multiple of this vector, such as 8, 3, 3, is also perpendicular to the plane. 


EXAMPLE 4 Find the area of the triangle with vertices P1, 4, 6, Q2, 5, 1,

The area A of the triangle PQR is half the area of this parallelogram, that is, 25 s82. 



818 .... CHAPTER 12 VECTORS AND THE GEOMETRY OF SPACE 

If we apply Theorems 5 and 6 to the standard basis vectors i , j, and k using 

2

we obtain 
i  j  k j  k  i k  i  j 
j  i  k k  j  i i  k  j 
Observe that 
i  j  j  i 

Thus, the cross product is not commutative. Also 

i  i  j  i  k  j 

whereas 

i  i  j  0  j  0 

So the associative law for multiplication does not usually hold; that is, in general, 

a  b  c  a  b  c 

However, some of the usual laws of algebra do hold for cross products. The following theorem 
summarizes the properties of vector products. 

8 
Theorem If a, b, and c are vectors and c is a scalar, then 

1. a  b  b  a 
2. (ca)  b  c(a  b)  a  (cb) 
3. a  (b  c)  a  b  a  c

5. a  b  c  a  b  c 
6. a  b  c  a  cb  a  bc 
These properties can be proved by writing the vectors in terms of their components 
and using the definition of a cross product. We give the proof of Property 5 and leave the 
remaining proofs as exercises. 

Proof of Property 5 If a  a1, a2, a3 , b  b1, b2, b3 , and c  c1, c2, c3 , then

 a  b  c 


The product a  b  c that occurs in Property 5 is called the scalar triple product of 
the vectors a, b, and c. Notice from Equation 9 that we can write the scalar triple product 
as a determinant:

SECTION 12.4 THE CROSS PRODUCT .... 819

Thus, we have proved the following formula. 

11 
The volume of the parallelepiped determined by the vectors a, b, and c is the 

magnitude of their scalar triple product: 

V  a  b  c 

If we use the formula in (11) and discover that the volume of the parallelepiped 

determined by a, b, and c is 0, then the vectors must lie in the same plane; that is, they are 

coplanar. 

EXAMPLE 5 Use the scalar triple product to show that the vectors a  1, 4, 7, 
b  2, 1, 4, and c  0, 9, 18 are coplanar.

Therefore, by (11) the volume of the parallelepiped determined by a, b, and c is 0. This 
means that a, b, and c are coplanar. 


FIGURE 4rF

 The idea of a cross product occurs often in physics. In particular, we consider a force F 
acting on a rigid body at a point given by a position vector r. (For instance, if we tighten 
a bolt by applying a force to a wrench as in Figure 4, we produce a turning effect.) The 

(relative to the origin) is defined to be the cross product of the position and force

torque 

vectors 

 r  F 

and measures the tendency of the body to rotate about the origin. The direction of the 
torque vector indicates the axis of rotation. According to Theorem 6, the magnitude of the 
torque vector is 

 r  F   r F sin 

where 

is the angle between the position and force vectors. Observe that the only com


ponent of F that can cause a rotation is the one perpendicular to r, that is, F sin 

. The 
magnitude of the torque is equal to the area of the parallelogram determined by r and F.

The Geometry of a Tetrahedron

A tetrahedron is a solid with four vertices, P, Q, R, and S, and four triangular faces as shown in 
the figure.

Let v1, v2, v3, and v4 be vectors with lengths equal to the areas of the faces opposite the 
vertices P, Q, R, and S, respectively, and directions perpendicular to the respective faces and 
pointing outward. Show that

The volume V of a tetrahedron is one-third the distance from a vertex to the opposite face,

and S3, 1, 2. 
3. 
Suppose the tetrahedron in the figure has a trirectangular vertex S. (This means that the three 
angles at S are all right angles.) Let A, B, and C be the areas of the three faces that meet at S, 
and let D be the area of the opposite face PQR. Using the result of Problem 1, or otherwise, 
show that

(its slope or angle of inclination) are given. The equation of the line can then be written 
using the point-slope form. 

Likewise, a line L in three-dimensional space is determined when we know a point 
P0x0, y0, z0 on L and the direction of L. In three dimensions the direction of a line is conveniently 
described by a vector, so we let v be a vector parallel to L. Let Px, y, z be an 
arbitrary point on L and let r0 and r be the position vectors of P0 and P (that is, they have 
representations OPA). If a A, as in Figure 1,

which is a vector equation of L. Each value of the parameter t gives the position vector 
r of a point on L. In other words, as t varies, the line is traced out by the tip of the vector 
r. As Figure 2 indicates, positive values of t correspond to points on L that lie on one 
side of P0, whereas negative values of t correspond to points that lie on the other side of P0. 
If the vector v that gives the direction of the line L is written in component form as 

v  a, b, c, then we have tv  ta, tb, tc. We can also write r  x, y, z and

The vector equation and parametric equations of a line are not unique. If we change the 
point or the parameter or choose a different parallel vector, then the equations change. For 
instance, if, instead of , we choose the point in Example 1, then the parametric 
equations of the line become 
6, 5, 15, 1, 3 
x  6  t y  5  4t z  1  2t

the numbers , , and are called direction numbers of . Since any vector parallel to

used as a set of direction numbers for .

These equations are called symmetric equations of L. Notice that the numbers a, b, and

of a vector parallel to L. If one of a, b, or c is 0, we can still eliminate t. For 
instance, if a  0, we could write the equations of L as 

y  y0 z  z0

This means that L lies in the vertical plane x  x0. 

EXAMPLE 2 

(a) Find parametric equations and symmetric equations of the line that passes through 
the points A2, 4, 3 and B3, 1, 1. 
(b) At what point does this line intersect the xy-plane? 
SOLUTION 

(a) We are not explicitly given a vector parallel to the line, but observe that the vector v 
l

with representation ABis parallel to the line and 

v  3  2, 1  4, 1  3  1, 5, 4 

Thus, direction numbers are a  1, b  5, and c  4. Taking the point 2, 4, 3 as 
P0,we see that parametric equations (2) are 

x  2  ty  4  5t z  3  4t 

and symmetric equations (3) are 

x  2 y  4 z  3 

1 54 

(b) The line intersects the xy-plane when z  0, so we put z  0 in the symmetric equations 
and obtain 
x  2 y  43 

1 54 

x  11 (111

This gives 4 and y  14, so the line intersects the xy-plane at the point 4 , 4 , 0). 


In general, the procedure of Example 2 shows that direction numbers of the line L 
through the points P0x0, y0, z0  and P1x1, y1, z1 are x1  x0, y1  y0, and z1  z0 and so 
symmetric equations of L are 

x  x0 y  y0 z  z0 

x1  x0 y1  y0 z1  z0 

Often, we need a description, not of an entire line, but of just a line segment. How, for 
instance, could we describe the line segment AB in Example 2? If we put t  0 in the parametric 
equations in Example 2(a), we get the point 2, 4, 3 and if we put t  1 we get 
3, 1, 1. So the line segment AB is described by the parametric equations

SECTION 12.5 EQUATIONS OF LINES AND PLANES .... 825 

In general, we know from Equation 1 that the vector equation of a line through the (tip 
of the) vector r0 in the direction of a vector v is r  r0  tv. If the line also passes through 
(the tip of) r1, then we can take v  r1  r0 and so its vector equation is 

r  r0  tr1  r0  1  tr0  tr1 

The line segment from r0 to r1 is given by the parameter interval 0  t 1. 

The line segment from to is given by the vector equation 
0  t 1rt  1  tr0  tr1

x 1  ty 2  3t z  4  t 
x 2sy 3  s z  3  4s 

are skew lines; that is, they do not intersect and are not parallel (and therefore do not lie 

in the same plane). 
SOLUTION The lines are not parallel because the corresponding vectors 1, 3, 1 and 
2, 1, 4 are not parallel. (Their components are not proportional.) If L1 and L2 had a 
point of intersection, there would be values of tand ssuch that 

1  t 2s 
2  3t 3  s 
4  t 3  4s 
t 11

But if we solve the first two equations, we get 5and s 85, and these values don’t 
satisfy the third equation. Therefore, there are no values of tand sthat satisfy the three 
equations. Thus, L1 and L2 do not intersect. Hence, L1 and L2 are skew lines. 

Planes 

Although a line in space is determined by a point and a direction, a plane in space is more 
difficult to describe. A single vector parallel to a plane is not enough to convey the “direction” 
of the plane, but a vector perpendicular to the plane does completely specify its direction. 
Thus, a plane in space is determined by a point P0x0, y0, z0 in the plane and a 
vector n that is orthogonal to the plane. This orthogonal vector n is called a normal 
vector. Let Px, y, z be an arbitrary point in the plane, and let r0 and r be the position 
vectors of Pand P. Then the vector is represented by PP

A. (See Figure 6.) The nor0 
r  r00 
mal vector n is orthogonal to every vector in the given plane. In particular, n is orthogonal 
to r  r0 and so we have 

5 
n  r  r0   0 

which can be rewritten as

To obtain a scalar equation for the plane, we write n  a, b, c, r  x, y, z, and 
r0  x0, y0, z0 . Then the vector equation (5) becomes

EXAMPLE 4 Find an equation of the plane through the point 2, 4, 1 with normal vector 
n  2, 3, 4. Find the intercepts and sketch the plane. 

SOLUTION Putting a  2, b  3, c  4, x0  2, y0  4, and z0  1 in Equation 7, we 
see that an equation of the plane is 

2x  2  3y  4  4z  1  0 

or 2x  3y  4z  12

To find the x-intercept we set y  z  0 in this equation and obtain x  6. Similarly, the 
y-intercept is 4 and the -intercept is 3. This enables us to sketch the portion of the plane 

z 

that lies in the first octant (see Figure 7).

EXAMPLE 6 Find the point at which the line with parametric equations , 
, intersects the plane . 
SOLUTION We substitute the expressions for , , and from the parametric equations into 
the equation of the plane: 
This simplifies to , so . Therefore, the point of intersection occurs 
when the parameter value is . Then , , 
and so the point of intersection is 
Two planes are parallel if their normal vectors are parallel. For instance, the planes 
and are parallel because their normal vectors are 
and and . If two planes are not parallel, then 
they intersect in a straight line and the angle between the two planes is defined as the acute 
angle between their normal vectors (see angle in Figure 9). 
EXAMPLE 7 
(a) Find the angle between the planes and . 
(b) Find symmetric equations for the line of intersection of these two planes. 
SOLUTION 
(a) The normal vectors of these planes are 
and so, if is the angle between the planes, Corollary 12.3.6 gives 
(b) We first need to find a point on . For instance, we can find the point where the line 
intersects the -plane by setting in the equations of both planes. This gives the 
equations and , whose solution is , . So the point 
lies on . 
Now we observe that, since lies in both planes, it is perpendicular to both of the 
normal vectors. Thus, a vector parallel to is given by the cross product 
and so the symmetric equations of can be written as

lie on both of these planes, and so the pair of linear equations represents the line of intersection 
of the planes (if they are not parallel). For instance, in Example 7 the line was 
given as the line of intersection of the planes and . The 
symmetric equations that we found for could be written as 
which is again a pair of linear equations. They exhibit as the line of intersection of the 
planes and . (See Figure 11.) 
In general, when we write the equations of a line in the symmetric form 
we can regard the line as the line of intersection of the two planes 
EXAMPLE 8 Find a formula for the distance from a point to the plane 
. 
SOLUTION Let be any point in the given plane and let be the vector corresponding 
to PAP . Then 
From Figure 12 you can see that the distance from to the plane is equal to the 
absolute value of the scalar projection of onto the normal vector . (See 
Section 12.3.) Thus 
Since lies in the plane, its coordinates satisfy the equation of the plane and so we 
have . Thus, the formula for can be written as 
EXAMPLE 9 Find the distance between the parallel planes and 
. 
SOLUTION First we note that the planes are parallel because their normal vectors 
and are parallel. To find the distance between the planes, 
we choose any point on one plane and calculate its distance to the other plane. In particular, 
if we put y  z  0 in the equation of the first plane, we get 10x  5 and so

EXAMPLE 10 In Example 3 we showed that the lines

L2: x  2sy  3  s z  3  4s 

are skew. Find the distance between them. 

SOLUTION Since the two lines L1 and L2 are skew, they can be viewed as lying on two 
parallel planes P1 and P2. The distance between L1 and L2 is the same as the distance 
between P1 and P2, which can be computed as in Example 9. The common normal 
vector to both planes must be orthogonal to both v1  1, 3, 1 (the direction of L1) 
and v2  2, 1, 4 (the direction of L2). So a normal vector is

If we put s  0 in the equations of L2, we get the point 0, 3, 3 on L2 and so an equation 
for P2 is

If we now set t  0 in the equations for L1, we get the point 1, 2, 4 on P1. So 
the distance between L1 and L2 is the same as the distance from 1, 2, 4 to 
13x  6y  5z  3  0. By Formula 9, this distance is

Putting 3D in Perspective 
Computer graphics programmers face the same challenge as the great painters of the past: how 
to represent a three-dimensional scene as a flat image on a two-dimensional plane (a screen or a 
canvas). To create the illusion of perspective, in which closer objects appear larger than those 
farther away, three-dimensional objects in the computer’s memory are projected onto a rectangular 
screen window from a viewpoint where the eye, or camera, is located. The viewing 
volume–the portion of space that will be visible–is the region contained by the four planes that 
pass through the viewpoint and edge of the screen window. If objects in the scene extend beyond 
these four planes, they must be truncated before pixel data are sent to the screen. These planes 
are therefore called clipping planes. 
1. Suppose the screen is represented by a rectangle in the -plane with vertices 
and , and the camera is placed at . A line in the scene passes 
through the points and . At what points should be clipped 
by the clipping planes? 
2. If the clipped line segment is projected on the screen window, identify the resulting line 
segment. 
3. Use parametric equations to plot the edges of the screen window, the clipped line segment, 
and its projection on the screen window. Then add sight lines connecting the viewpoint to 
each end of the clipped segments to verify that the projection is correct. 
4. A rectangle with vertices , , , and 
is added to the scene. The line intersects this rectangle. To make the rectangle 
appear opaque, a programmer can use hidden line rendering which removes portions 
of objects that are behind other objects. Identify the portion of L that should be removed.

LABORATORY PROJECT 
|||| 12.6 Cylinders and Quadric Surfaces 
We have already looked at two special types of surfaces— planes (in Section 12.5) and 
spheres (in Section 12.1). Here we investigate two other types of surfaces— cylinders and 
quadric surfaces. 
In order to sketch the graph of a surface, it is useful to determine the curves of intersection 
of the surface with planes parallel to the coordinate planes. These curves are called 
traces (or cross-sections) of the surface. 
Cylinders 
A cylinder is a surface that consists of all lines (called rulings) that are parallel to a given 
line and pass through a given plane curve. 
EXAMPLE 1 Sketch the graph of the surface . 
SOLUTION Notice that the equation of the graph, , doesn’t involve y. This means that 
any vertical plane with equation (parallel to the -plane) intersects the graph in a 
curve with equation . So these vertical traces are parabolas. Figure 1 shows how 
the graph is formed by taking the parabola z  x2 in the xz-plane and moving it in the

y  k xz

z  x2

SECTION 12.6 CYLINDERS AND QUADRIC SURFACES .... 833 

direction of the y-axis. The graph is a surface, called a parabolic cylinder, made up of 
infinitely many shifted copies of the same parabola. Here the rulings of the cylinder are 
parallel to the y-axis. 

x y 
0 
z 
FIGURE 1 

The surface z=˜ is a parabolic cylinder. 

We noticed that the variable y is missing from the equation of the cylinder in Example 
1. This is typical of a surface whose rulings are parallel to one of the coordinate axes. 
If one of the variables x, y, or z is missing from the equation of a surface, then the surface 
is a cylinder. 

EXAMPLE 2 Identify and sketch the surfaces. 

(a) x2  y2  1 (b) y2  z2  1 
SOLUTION 

(a) Since z is missing and the equations x2  y2  1, z  k represent a circle with 
radius 1 in the plane z  k, the surface x2  y2  1 is a circular cylinder whose axis is 
the z-axis (see Figure 2). Here the rulings are vertical lines. 
(b) In this case x is missing and the surface is a circular cylinder whose axis is the x-axis 
(see Figure 3). It is obtained by taking the circle y2  z2  1, x  0 in the yz-plane and 
moving it parallel to the x-axis.

| NOTE When you are dealing with surfaces, it is important to recognize that an equation 
like x2  y2  1 represents a cylinder and not a circle. The trace of the cylinder 
x2  y2  1 in the xy-plane is the circle with equations x2  y2  1, z  0. 

Quadric Surfaces 

A quadric surface is the graph of a second-degree equation in three variables x, y, and z. 
The most general such equation is 

Ax2  By2  Cz2  Dxy  Eyz  Fxz  Gx  Hy  Iz  J  0 


834 .... CHAPTER 12 VECTORS AND THE GEOMETRY OF SPACE 

where A, B, C, ..., J are constants, but by translation and rotation it can be brought into 
one of the two standard forms 

Ax2  By2  Cz2  J  0 or Ax2  By2  Iz  0 

Quadric surfaces are the counterparts in three dimensions of the conic sections in the plane. 
(See Section 10.5 for a review of conic sections.) 

EXAMPLE 3 Use traces to sketch the quadric surface with equation 

y2 z2 
x2   1

SOLUTION By substituting z  0, we find that the trace in the xy-plane is x2  y29  1, 
which we recognize as an equation of an ellipse. In general, the horizontal trace in the

if 1  k  1 
if 3  k  3 

Figure 4 shows how drawing some traces indicates the shape of the surface. It’s called an 
FIGURE 4 ellipsoid because all of its traces are ellipses. Notice that it is symmetric with respect to 
y@ z@ each coordinate plane; this is a reflection of the fact that its equation involves only even 

The ellipsoid ˜+ + =1

94 powers of x, y, and . z 


EXAMPLE 4 Use traces to sketch the surface z  4x2  y2. 

SOLUTION If we put x  0, we get z  y2, so the yz-plane intersects the surface in a 
parabola. If we put x  k (a constant), we get z  y2  4k2. This means that if we 
slice the graph with any plane parallel to the yz-plane, we obtain a parabola that opens 
upward. Similarly, if y  k, the trace is z  4x2  k2, which is again a parabola that 
opens upward. If we put z  k, we get the horizontal traces 4x2  y2  k, which we 
recognize as a family of ellipses. Knowing the shapes of the traces, we can sketch the 
graph in Figure 5. Because of the elliptical and parabolic traces, the quadric surface 
z  4x2  y2 is called an elliptic paraboloid.

open upward. The traces in y  k are the parabolas z  x2  k2, which open downward. 
The horizontal traces are y2  x2  k, a family of hyperbolas. We draw the families 
of traces in Figure 6, and we show how the traces appear when placed in their

This surface is called a hyperboloid of one sheet and is sketched in Figure 9. 
The idea of using traces to draw a surface is employed in three-dimensional graphing 
software for computers. In most such software, traces in the vertical planes and 
are drawn for equally spaced values of , and parts of the graph are eliminated using 
hidden line removal. Table 1 shows computer-drawn graphs of the six basic types of 
quadric surfaces in standard form. All surfaces are symmetric with respect to the -axis. If 
a quadric surface is symmetric about a different axis, its equation changes accordingly.

|||| 12.7 Cylindrical and Spherical Coordinates 

Recall that in plane geometry we introduced the polar coordinate system in order to give 
a convenient description of certain curves and regions. (See Section 10.3.) In three dimensions 
there are two coordinate systems that are similar to polar coordinates and give 
convenient descriptions of some commonly occurring surfaces and solids. They will be 
especially useful in Chapter 15 when we compute volumes and triple integrals. 

Cylindrical Coordinates

In the cylindrical coordinate system, a point P in three-dimensional space is represented

Cylindrical coordinates are useful in problems that involve symmetry about an axis, and 
the z-axis is chosen to coincide with this axis of symmetry. For instance, the axis of the 
circular cylinder with Cartesian equation x2  y2  c2 is the z-axis. In cylindrical coordinates 
this cylinder has the very simple equation r  c. (See Figure 3.) This is the reason 

for the name “cylindrical” coordinates. 
EXAMPLE 2 Describe the surface whose equation in cylindrical coordinates is z  r. 


FIGURE 3 

SOLUTION The equation says that the z-value, or height, of each point on the surface is the 

r=c, a cylinder 

doesn’t appear, it can 

same as r, the distance from the point to the -axis. Because

z 


vary. So any horizontal trace in the plane z  k k  0 is a circle of radius k. These 
traces suggest that the surface is a cone. This prediction can be confirmed by converting 
the equation into rectangular coordinates. From the first equation in (2) we have 

2

z2  r2  x2  y

We recognize the equation z2  x2  y2 (by comparison with Table 1 in Section 12.6) as 
being a circular cone whose axis is the -axis (see Figure 4).

which is the equation of a sphere with center and radius . 
EXAMPLE 8 Use a computer to draw a picture of the solid that remains when a hole of 
radius 3 is drilled through the center of a sphere of radius 4. 
SOLUTION To keep the equations simple, let’s choose the coordinate system so that the 
center of the sphere is at the origin and the axis of the cylinder that forms the hole is the 
-axis. We could use either cylindrical or spherical coordinates to describe the solid, but 
the description is somewhat simpler if we use cylindrical coordinates. Then the equation 
of the cylinder is and the equation of the sphere is , or 
. The points in the solid lie outside the cylinder and inside the sphere, so 
they satisfy the inequalities 
To ensure that the computer graphs only the appropriate parts of these surfaces, we find 
where they intersect by solving the equations and : 
The solid lies between and , so we ask the computer to graph the surfaces 
with the following equations and domains:

The calculus of vector- 
(Chapter) 
valued functions is used 
in Section 13.4 to prove 
Kepler’s laws. These 
describe the motion of 
the planets about the Sun 
and also apply to the orbit 
of a satellite about the 
Earth, such as the Hubble 
Space Telescope. 


Vector Functions 



The functions that we have been using so far have been real-
valued functions. We now study functions whose values are 
vectors because such functions are needed to describe curves 

and surfaces in space. We will also use vector-valued functions 
to describe the motion of objects through space. In particular, 
we will use them to derive Kepler’s laws of planetary motion. 

|||| 13.1 Vector Functions and Space Curves 

In general, a function is a rule that assigns to each element in the domain an element in the 
range. A vector-valued function, or vector function, is simply a function whose domain 
is a set of real numbers and whose range is a set of vectors. We are most interested in vector 
functions r whose values are three-dimensional vectors. This means that for every number 
t in the domain of r there is a unique vector in V3 denoted by rt. If f t, tt, and ht 
are the components of the vector rt, then f , t, and h are real-valued functions called the 
component functions of r and we can write 

rt   f t, tt, ht  f ti  ttj  htk 

We use the letter t to denote the independent variable because it represents time in most 
applications of vector functions. 

EXAMPLE 1 If 

rt  t3, ln3  t, st 

then the component functions are 

f t  t3 tt  ln3  t ht  st 

By our usual convention, the domain of r consists of all values of t for which the expression 
for rt is defined. The expressions t3, ln3  t, and st are all defined when 
3  t  0 and t  0. Therefore, the domain of r is the interval 0, 3. 

The limit of a vector function r is defined by taking the limits of its component functions 
as follows.

functions obey the same rules as limits of real-valued functions (see Exercise 41).

limits of the component functions of r:

A vector function r is continuous at a if 

lim rt  ra 

t l a 

In view of Definition 1, we see that r is continuous at a if and only if its component functions 
,f t, and h are continuous at a. 

There is a close connection between continuous vector functions and space curves. 
Suppose that f , t, and h are continuous real-valued functions on an interval I. Then the set 
C of all points x, y, z in space, where 

2 
x  f t y  tt z  ht 

and t varies throughout the interval I, is called a space curve. The equations in (2) are 
called parametric equations of C and t is called a parameter. We can think of C as being 
traced out by a moving particle whose position at time t is  f t, tt, ht. If we now consider 
the vector function rt   f t, tt, ht, then rt is the position vector of the 
point P f t, tt, ht on C. Thus, any continuous vector function r defines a space curve 
C that is traced out by the tip of the moving vector rt, as shown in Figure 1. 

EXAMPLE 3 Describe the curve defined by the vector function 

rt  1  t, 2  5t, 1  6t 

SOLUTION The corresponding parametric equations are 

x  1  ty  2  5t z  1  6t 

which we recognize from Equations 12.5.2 as parametric equations of a line passing 
through the point 1, 2, 1 and parallel to the vector 1, 5, 6. Alternatively, we could 
observe that the function can be written as r  r0  tv, where r0  1, 2, 1 and 
v  1, 5, 6, and this is the vector equation of a line as given by Equation 12.5.1. 


Plane curves can also be represented in vector notation. For instance, the curve given 
by the parametric equations x  t2  2t and y  t  1 (see Example 1 in Section 10.1) 
could also be described by the vector equation 

rt  t2  2t, t  1  t2  2t i  t  1 j 

where i  1, 0 and j  0, 1.

SOLUTION The parametric equations for this curve are 

x  cos ty  sin t z  t 

Since x2  y2  cos2t  sin2t  1, the curve must lie on the circular cylinder 
x2  y2  1. The point x, y, z lies directly above the point x, y, 0, which moves 
counterclockwise around the circle x2  y2  1 in the xy-plane. (See Example 2 in 
Section 10.1.) Since z  t, the curve spirals upward around the cylinder as t increases. 
The curve, shown in Figure 2, is called a helix.

The corkscrew shape of the helix in Example 4 is familiar from its occurrence in coiled 
springs. It also occurs in the model of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid, the genetic material 
of living cells). In 1953 James Watson and Francis Crick showed that the structure of the 
DNA molecule is that of two linked, parallel helices that are intertwined as in Figure 3. 

In Examples 3 and 4 we were given vector equations of curves and asked for a geometric 
description or sketch. In the next two examples we are given a geometric description 
of a curve and are asked to find parametric equations for the curve. 

EXAMPLE 5 Find a vector equation and parametric equations for the line segment that 
joins the point P1, 3, 2 to the point Q2, 1, 3. 

SOLUTION In Section 12.5 we found a vector equation for the line segment that joins the 
tip of the vector r0 to the tip of the vector r1: 

rt  1  tr0  tr10  t  1 

(See Equation 12.5.4.) Here we take r0  1, 3, 2 and r1  2, 1, 3 to obtain a 
vector equation of the line segment from P to Q: 

rt  1  t1, 3, 2  t2, 1, 3 0  t  1 
or

EXAMPLE 6 Find a vector function that represents the curve of intersection of the cylinder 
and the plane . 
SOLUTION Figure 5 shows how the plane and the cylinder intersect, and Figure 6 shows the 
curve of intersection C, which is an ellipse. 
The projection of C onto the xy-plane is the circle . So we know 
from Example 2 in Section 10.1 that we can write 
From the equation of the plane, we have 
So we can write parametric equations for C as 
The corresponding vector equation is 
This equation is called a parametrization of the curve C. The arrows in Figure 6 indicate 
the direction in which C is traced as the parameter t increases. 
Using Computers to Draw Space Curves 
Space curves are inherently more difficult to draw by hand than plane curves; for an accurate 
representation we need to use technology. For instance, Figure 7 shows a computergenerated 
graph of the curve with parametric equations 
It’s called a toroidal spiral because it lies on a torus. Another interesting curve, the trex

Even when a computer is used to draw a space curve, optical illusions make it difficult 
to get a good impression of what the curve really looks like. (This is especially true in 
Figure 8. See Exercise 42.) The next example shows how to cope with this problem. 

EXAMPLE 7 Use a computer to sketch the curve with vector equation rt  t, t2, t3 . 
This curve is called a twisted cubic. 

SOLUTION We start by using the computer to plot the curve with parametric equations 
x  t, y  t2, z  t3 for 2  t  2. The result is shown in Figure 9(a), but it’s hard to 
see the true nature of the curve from that graph alone. Most three-dimensional computer 
graphing programs allow the user to enclose a curve or surface in a box instead of displaying 
the coordinate axes. When we look at the same curve in a box in Figure 9(b), we 
have a much clearer picture of the curve. We can see that it climbs from a lower corner 
of the box to the upper corner nearest us, and it twists as it climbs.

We get an even better idea of the curve when we view it from different vantage 
points. Part (c) shows the result of rotating the box to give another viewpoint. Parts (d), 
(e), and (f ) show the views we get when we look directly at a face of the box. In particular, 
part (d) shows the view from directly above the box. It is the projection of the 
curve on the -plane, namely, the parabola . Part (e) shows the projection on the 
-plane, the cubic curve . It’s now obvious why the given curve is called a 
twisted cubic. 
Another method of visualizing a space curve is to draw it on a surface. For instance, the 
twisted cubic in Example 7 lies on the parabolic cylinder . (Eliminate the parameter 
from the first two parametric equations, and .) Figure 10 shows both the 
cylinder and the twisted cubic, and we see that the curve moves upward from the origin 
along the surface of the cylinder. We also used this method in Example 4 to visualize the 
helix lying on the circular cylinder (see Figure 2). 
A third method for visualizing the twisted cubic is to realize that it also lies on the cylinder 
. So it can be viewed as the curve of intersection of the cylinders and 
. (See Figure 11.) 
We have seen that an interesting space curve, the helix, occurs in the model of DNA. 
Another notable example of a space curve in science is the trajectory of a positively 
charged particle in orthogonally oriented electric and magnetic fields E and B. Depending 
on the initial velocity given the particle at the origin, the path of the particle is either a 
space curve whose projection on the horizontal plane is the cycloid we studied in Section 
10.1 [Figure 12(a)] or a curve whose projection is the trochoid investigated in Exercise 38 
in Section 10.1 [Figure 12(b)].

In Visual 13.1B you can rotate the box 
in Figure 9 to see the curve from any 
viewpoint. 
Visual 13.1C shows how curves arise 
as intersections of surfaces. 
|||| Some computer algebra systems provide us 
with a clearer picture of a space curve by enclosing 
it in a tube. Such a plot enables us to see 
whether one part of a curve passes in front of or 
behind another part of the curve. For example, 
Figure 13 shows the curve of Figure 12(b) as rendered 
by the tubeplot command in Maple.

to sketch the curve by hand as viewed from above, with gaps 
indicating where the curve passes over itself. Start by showing 
that the projection of the curve onto the xy-plane has polar 

coordinates r  2 cos 1.5t and 

 t, so r varies between 1 
and 3. Then show that z has maximum and minimum values

If two objects travel through space along two different curves, 
it’s often important to know whether they will collide. (Will a 
missile hit its moving target? Will two aircraft collide?) The 
when the projection is halfway between r  1 and r  3. 

; When you have finished your sketch, use a computer to draw 
the curve with viewpoint directly above and compare with your 
sketch. Then use the computer to draw the curve from several 
other viewpoints. You can get a better impression of the curve 
if you plot a tube with radius 0.2 around the curve. (Use the 
tubeplotcommand in Maple.)

|||| 13.2 Derivatives and Integrals of Vector Functions 

Later in this chapter we are going to use vector functions to describe the motion of planets 
and other objects through space. Here we prepare the way by developing the calculus 
of vector functions. 

Derivatives 

The derivative rof a vector function r is defined in much the same way as for real-
valued functions:

if this limit exists. The geometric significance of this definition is shown in Figure 1. If the 

l

points P and Q have position vectors rt and rt h, then PQrepresents the vector 
rt h rt, which can therefore be regarded as a secant vector. If h 0, the scalar 
multiple 1
hrt h rt has the same direction as rt h rt. As h l 0, it 
appears that this vector approaches a vector that lies on the tangent line. For this reason, 
the vector rt is called the tangent vector to the curve defined by r at the point P, provided 
that rt exists and rt  0. The tangent line to C at P is defined to be the line 
through P parallel to the tangent vector rt. We will also have occasion to consider the 
unit tangent vector, which is

Example 3 is 

rt  2 cos t, sin t, 0 

A curve given by a vector function rt on an interval I is called smooth if r is continuous 
and rt  0 (except possibly at any endpoints of I ). For instance, the helix in 
Example 3 is smooth because rt is never 0.

SOLUTION Since 
rt  3t2, 2t 

we have r0  0, 0  0 and, therefore, the curve is not smooth. The point that corresponds 
to t  0 is (1, 0), and we see from the graph in Figure 4 that there is a sharp 
corner, called a cusp, at (1, 0). Any curve with this type of behavior—an abrupt change 
in direction—is not smooth. 

A curve, such as the semicubical parabola, that is made up of a finite number of smooth 
pieces is called piecewise smooth. 

Differentiation Rules 

The next theorem shows that the differentiation formulas for real-valued functions have 
their counterparts for vector-valued functions.

This theorem can be proved either directly from Definition 1 or by using Theorem 2 and 
the corresponding differentiation formulas for real-valued functions. The proofs of Formulas 
1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 are left as exercises. 

Proof of Formula 4 Let 

ut   f1t, f2t, f3t vt   t1t, t2t, t3t

EXAMPLE 5 Show that if  rt  c (a constant), then rt is orthogonal to rt for all t . 
SOLUTION Since 

rt  rt   rt2  c2 

and c2 is a constant, Formula 4 of Theorem 3 gives 
d 

0  	rt  rt
  rt  rt  rt  rt  2rt  rt 

dt 

Thus, rt  rt  0, which says that rt is orthogonal to rt. 
Geometrically, this result says that if a curve lies on a sphere with center the origin, 
then the tangent vector rt is always perpendicular to the position vector rt. 

Integrals 

The definite integral of a continuous vector function rt can be defined in much the same 
way as for real-valued functions except that the integral is a vector. But then we can 
express the integral of r in terms of the integrals of its component functions f, t, and h as 
follows. (We use the notation of Chapter 5.)

This means that we can evaluate an integral of a vector function by integrating each component 
function.

follows:

It is often useful to parametrize a curve with respect to arc length because arc length 
arises naturally from the shape of the curve and does not depend on a particular coordinate 
system. If a curve rt is already given in terms of a parameter t and st is the arc length 
function given by Equation 6, then we may be able to solve for t as a function of s: t  ts. 
Then the curve can be reparametrized in terms of s by substituting for t : r  rts. Thus, 
if s  3 for instance, rt3 is the position vector of the point 3 units of length along the 
curve from its starting point.

and indicates the direction of the curve. From Figure 4 you can see that Tt changes direc


tion very slowly when C is fairly straight, but it changes direction more quickly when C 
bends or twists more sharply. 

The curvature of C at a given point is a measure of how quickly the curve changes direction 
at that point. Specifically, we define it to be the magnitude of the rate of change of the

The result of Example 3 shows that small circles have large curvature and large circles 
have small curvature, in accordance with our intuition. We can see directly from the definition 
of curvature that the curvature of a straight line is always 0 because the tangent vector 
is constant. 

Although Formula 9 can be used in all cases to compute the curvature, the formula 
given by the following theorem is often more convenient to apply.

The Normal and Binormal Vectors 

At a given point on a smooth space curve rt, there are many vectors that are orthogonal 
to the unit tangent vector Tt. We single out one by observing that, since  Tt  1 for 
all t, we have Tt  Tt  0 by Example 5 in Section 13.2, so Tt is orthogonal to

moves along the curve as t varies. This TNB 
frame plays an important role in the branch of 
mathematics known as differential geometry and 
in its applications to the motion of spacecraft.

The plane determined by the normal and binormal vectors N and B at a point P on a 
curve C is called the normal plane of C at P. It consists of all lines that are orthogonal 
to the tangent vector T. The plane determined by the vectors T and N is called the osculating 
plane of C at P. The name comes from the Latin osculum, meaning “kiss.” It is the 
plane that comes closest to containing the part of the curve near P. (For a plane curve, the 
osculating plane is simply the plane that contains the curve.) 

The circle that lies in the osculating plane of C at P, has the same tangent as C at P, lies 

on the concave side of (toward which N points), and has radius 

 1.

methods to derive Kepler’s First Law of planetary motion. 

Suppose a particle moves through space so that its position vector at time t is rt. 
Notice from Figure 1 that, for small values of h, the vector

approximates the direction of the particle moving along the curve rt. Its magnitude mea-

Thus, the velocity vector is also the tangent vector and points in the direction of the tangent 
line. 

The speed of the particle at time t is the magnitude of the velocity vector, that is,  vt. 
This is appropriate because, from (2) and from Equation 13.3.7, we have

EXAMPLE 6 A projectile is fired with muzzle speed 150 ms and angle of elevation 45 
from a position 10 m above ground level. Where does the projectile hit the ground, and 
with what speed? 

SOLUTION If we place the origin at ground level, then the initial position of the projectile 
is (0, 10) and so we need to adjust Equations 4 by adding 10 to the expression for y.

Tangential and Normal Components of Acceleration 

When we study the motion of a particle, it is often useful to resolve the acceleration into 
two components, one in the direction of the tangent and the other in the direction of the 
normal. If we write v  v for the speed of the particle, then 

rt vt v

Tt 

and so v  vT 
If we differentiate both sides of this equation with respect to t , we get

This resolution is illustrated in Figure 7. 

Let’s look at what Formula 7 says. The first thing to notice is that the binormal vector 
B is absent. No matter how an object moves through space, its acceleration always lies in 
the plane of T and N (the osculating plane). (Recall that T gives the direction of motion 
and N points in the direction the curve is turning.) Next we notice that the tangential component 
of acceleration is v, the rate of change of speed, and the normal component of 

aT

acceleration is

, the curvature times the square of the speed. This makes sense if we 

think of a passenger in a car—a sharp turn in a road means a large value of the curvature 

, so the component of the acceleration perpendicular to the motion is large and the passenger 
is thrown against a car door. High speed around the turn has the same effect; in fact, 
if you double your speed, aN is increased by a factor of 4. 

Although we have expressions for the tangential and normal components of acceleration 
in Equations 8, it’s desirable to have expressions that depend only on r, r, and r . To 
this end we take the dot product of v  vT with a as given by Equation 7:

Kepler’s Laws of Planetary Motion 
We now describe one of the great accomplishments of calculus by showing how the material 
of this chapter can be used to prove Kepler’s laws of planetary motion. After 20 years 
of studying the astronomical observations of the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, the 
German mathematician and astronomer Johannes Kepler (1571–1630) formulated the following 
three laws. 
Kepler’s Laws 
1. A planet revolves around the Sun in an elliptical orbit with the Sun at one focus. 
2. The line joining the Sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times. 
3. The square of the period of revolution of a planet is proportional to the cube of 
the length of the major axis of its orbit. 
In his book Principia Mathematica of 1687, Sir Isaac Newton was able to show that 
these three laws are consequences of two of his own laws, the Second Law of Motion and 
the Law of Universal Gravitation. In what follows we prove Kepler’s First Law. The remaining 
laws are left as exercises (with hints). 
Since the gravitational force of the Sun on a planet is so much larger than the forces 
exerted by other celestial bodies, we can safely ignore all bodies in the universe except the 
Sun and one planet revolving about it. We use a coordinate system with the Sun at the origin 
and we let be the position vector of the planet. (Equally well, could be the 
position vector of the Moon or a satellite moving around the Earth or a comet moving 
around a star.) The velocity vector is and the acceleration vector is . We use 
the following laws of Newton: 
where is the gravitational force on the planet, and are the masses of the planet and 
the Sun, is the gravitational constant, , and is the unit vector in the 
direction of .

Therefore r v  h 

where h is a constant vector. (We may assume that h  0; that is, r and v are not parallel.) 
This means that the vector r  rt is perpendicular to h for all values of t, so the planet 
always lies in the plane through the origin perpendicular to h. Thus, the orbit of the planet 
is a plane curve. 

To prove Kepler’s First Law we rewrite the vector h as follows: 

h  r v  r r r u r u

At this point it is convenient to choose the coordinate axes so that the standard basis

vector k points in the direction of the vector h. Then the planet moves in the xy-plane. 

u Since both v h and u are perpendicular to h, Equation 11 shows that c lies in the 
xy-plane. This means that we can choose the x- and y-axes so that the vector i lies in the

Comparing with Theorem 10.6.6, we see that Equation 12 is the polar equation of a conic 
section with focus at the origin and eccentricity e. We know that the orbit of a planet is a 
closed curve and so the conic must be an ellipse. 

This completes the derivation of Kepler’s First Law. We will guide you through the 
derivation of the Second and Third Laws in the Applied Project on page 880. The proofs 
of these three laws show that the methods of this chapter provide a powerful tool for 
describing some of the laws of nature.

2. 
The line joining the Sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal times. 
3. 
The square of the period of revolution of a planet is proportional to the cube of the 
length of the major axis of its orbit. 
Kepler formulated these laws because they fitted the astronomical data. He wasn’t able to see 
why they were true or how they related to each other. But Sir Isaac Newton, in his Principia 
Mathematica of 1687, showed how to deduce Kepler’s three laws from two of Newton’s own 
laws, the Second Law of Motion and the Law of Universal Gravitation. In Section 13.4 we 
proved Kepler’s First Law using the calculus of vector functions. In this project we guide you 
through the proofs of Kepler’s Second and Third Laws and explore some of their consequences. 

1. 
Use the following steps to prove Kepler’s Second Law. The notation is the same as in 
the proof of the First Law in Section 13.4. In particular, use polar coordinates so that

The period of the Earth’s orbit is approximately 365.25 days. Use this fact and Kepler’s 
Third Law to find the length of the major axis of the Earth’s orbit. You will need the mass of 
the Sun, M  1.99  1030 kg, and the gravitational constant, G  6.67  1011 N

It’s possible to place a satellite into orbit about the Earth so that it remains fixed above a 
given location on the equator. Compute the altitude that is needed for such a satellite. The 
Earth’s mass is 5.98  1024 kg; its radius is 6.37  106 m. (This orbit is called the Clarke 
Geosynchronous Orbit after Arthur C. Clarke, who first proposed the idea in 1948. The first 
such satellite, Syncom II, was launched in July 1963.)

In designing transfer curves to connect sections of straight railroad 
tracks, it’s important to realize that the acceleration of the 
train should be continuous so that the reactive force exerted by 
the train on the track is also continuous. Because of the formulas 
for the components of acceleration in Section 13.4, this will 
be the case if the curvature varies continuously.

Partial Derivatives 
We can visualize a function of two 
variables by its graph (a surface) or 
by its level curves (a contour map).

So far we have dealt with the calculus of functions of a single 
variable. But, in the real world, physical quantities often 
depend on two or more variables, so in this chapter we turn 

our attention to functions of several variables and extend the 
basic ideas of differential calculus to such functions. 

|||| 14.1 Functions of Several Variables 

In this section we study functions of two or more variables from four points of view: 

 verbally (by a description in words) 
 numerically (by a table of values) 
 algebraically (by an explicit formula) 
 visually (by a graph or level curves) 
Functions of Two Variables 

The temperature T at a point on the surface of the Earth at any given time depends on the 
longitude x and latitude y of the point. We can think of T as being a function of the two 
variables x and y, or as a function of the pair x, y. We indicate this functional dependence 
by writing T  fx, y. 

The volume V of a circular cylinder depends on its radius r and height h. In fact, we 

know that

Definition A function f of two variables is a rule that assigns to each ordered pair 
of real numbers x, y in a set D a unique real number denoted by fx, y. The set 
D is the domain of f and its range is the set of values that f takes on, that is, 
 fx, yx, y  D. 

We often write z  fx, y to make explicit the value taken on by f at the general point 
x, y. The variables x and y are independent variables and z is the dependent variable. 
[Compare this with the notation y  fx for functions of a single variable.] 

A function of two variables is just a function whose domain is a subset of and whose

2 
range is a subset of . One way of visualizing such a function is by means of an arrow diagram 
(see Figure 1), where the domain D is represented as a subset of the xy-plane.

Wind-chill index as a function of air 
temperature and wind speed 

|||| THE NEW WIND-CHILL INDEX 

A new wind-chill index was introduced in 
November of 2001 and is more accurate than the 
old index at measuring how cold it feels when 
it’s windy. The new index is based on a model of 
how fast a human face loses heat. It was developed 
through clinical trials in which volunteers 
were exposed to a variety of temperatures and 
wind speeds in a refrigerated wind tunnel. 

If a function f is given by a formula and no domain is specified, then the domain of f

real number.

The expression for f makes sense if the denominator is not 0 and the quantity under the 
square root sign is nonnegative. So the domain of f is 

D  x, y x y 1 0, x  1 

The inequality x y 1 0, or y x 1, describes the points that lie on or above 
the line y  x 1, while x  1 means that the points on the line x  1 must be 
excluded from the domain. (See Figure 2.) 

(b) f 3, 2  3 ln22 3  3 ln 1  0 
Since lny2 x is defined only when y2 x 0, that is, x y2, the domain of f is 
D  x, y x y2 . This is the set of points to the left of the parabola x  y2. (See 
Figure 3.) 


Not all functions are given by explicit formulas. The function in the next example is 
described verbally and by numerical estimates of its values. 

EXAMPLE 2 In regions with severe winter weather, the wind-chill index is often used to 
describe the apparent severity of the cold. This index W is a subjective temperature that 
depends on the actual temperature T and the wind speed v. So W is a function of T and ,v 
and we can write W  f T, v. Table 1 records values of W compiled by the National 
Weather Service of the U.S. and the Meteorological Service of Canada.

EXAMPLE 3 In 1928 Charles Cobb and Paul Douglas published a study in which they

other factors affecting economic performance, their model proved to be remarkably 
accurate. The function they used to model production was of the form 

1 
	K1

PL, K  bL

where P is the total production (the monetary value of all goods produced in a year), 
L is the amount of labor (the total number of person-hours worked in a year), and K is 
the amount of capital invested (the monetary worth of all machinery, equipment, and 
buildings). In Section 14.3 we will show how the form of Equation 1 follows from certain 
economic assumptions. 

Cobb and Douglas used economic data published by the government to obtain 
Table 2. They took the year 1899 as a baseline and P, L, and K for 1899 were each 
assigned the value 100. The values for other years were expressed as percentages of 
the 1899 figures. 

Cobb and Douglas used the method of least squares to fit the data of Table 2 to the 
function

PL, K  1.01L0.75K0.25 

(See Exercise 71 for the details.) 

If we use the model given by the function in Equation 2 to compute the production in 
the years 1910 and 1920, we get the values 

P147, 208  1.011470.752080.25  161.9 

P194, 407  1.011940.754070.25  235.8 

which are quite close to the actual values, 159 and 231. 

The production function (1) has subsequently been used in many settings, ranging 
from individual firms to global economic questions. It has become known as the 
Cobb-Douglas production function. Its domain is L, K L  0, K  0 because 
L and K represent labor and capital and are therefore never negative.

Graphs 

Another way of visualizing the behavior of a function of two variables is to consider its 
graph. 

Definition If f is a function of two variables with domain D, then the graph of f 
is the set of all points x, y, z in 3 such that z  fx, y and x, y is in D. 

f(x, y) 
0 
z

x 
D 
S 
{x, y, f(x, y)} 
(x, y, 0) 
Just as the graph of a function f of one variable is a curve C with equation y  fx, so 
the graph of a function f of two variables is a surface S with equation z  fx, y. We can 
visualize the graph S of f as lying directly above or below its domain D in the xy-plane 
(see Figure 5). 

EXAMPLE 5 Sketch the graph of the function fx, y  6  3x  2y. 

SOLUTION The graph of f has the equation z  6  3x  2y, or 3x  2y  z  6, which 
represents a plane. To graph the plane we first find the intercepts. Putting y  z  0 in

FIGURE 5 

the equation, we get x  2 as the x-intercept. Similarly, the y-intercept is 3 and the 
z-intercept is 6. This helps us sketch the portion of the graph that lies in the first octant 
(Figure 6).

The function in Example 5 is a special case of the function 

fx, y  ax  by  c 

which is called a linear function. The graph of such a function has the equation 
z  ax  by  c, or ax  by  z  c  0, so it is a plane. In much the same way that 
linear functions of one variable are important in single-variable calculus, we will see that 
linear functions of two variables play a central role in multivariable calculus. 

EXAMPLE 6 Sketch the graph of tx, y  s9  x2  y2. 


SECTION 14.1 FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES .... 891 
SOLUTION The graph has equation . We square both sides of this equation 
to obtain , or , which we recognize as an equation 
of the sphere with center the origin and radius 3. But, since , the graph of is 
just the top half of this sphere (see Figure 7). 
EXAMPLE 7 Use a computer to draw the graph of the Cobb-Douglas production function 
. 
SOLUTION Figure 8 shows the graph of P for values of the labor L and capital K that lie 
between 0 and 300. The computer has drawn the surface by plotting vertical traces. 
We see from these traces that the value of the production P increases as either L or K 
increases, as is to be expected. 
EXAMPLE 8 Find the domain and range and sketch the graph of . 
SOLUTION Notice that is defined for all possible ordered pairs of real numbers , 
so the domain is , the entire xy-plane. The range of h is the set of all nonnegative 
real numbers. [Notice that and , so for all x and y.] 
The graph of h has the equation , which is the elliptic paraboloid that 
we sketched in Example 4 in Section 12.6. Horizontal traces are ellipses and vertical 
traces are parabolas (see Figure 9). 
Computer programs are readily available for graphing functions of two variables. In 
most such programs, traces in the vertical planes and are drawn for equally 
spaced values of k and parts of the graph are eliminated using hidden line removal.

Figure 10 shows computer-generated graphs of several functions. Notice that we get an 
especially good picture of a function when rotation is used to give views from different 
vantage points. In parts (a) and (b) the graph of is very flat and close to the -plane 
except near the origin; this is because is very small when or is large. 
Level Curves 
So far we have two methods for visualizing functions: arrow diagrams and graphs. A third 
method, borrowed from mapmakers, is a contour map on which points of constant elevation 
are joined to form contour curves, or level curves. 
Definition The level curves of a function of two variables are the curves with 
equations , where is a constant (in the range of ). 
A level curve is the set of all points in the domain of at which takes on 
a given value . In other words, it shows where the graph of has height . 
You can see from Figure 11 the relation between level curves and horizontal traces. The 
level curves are just the traces of the graph of in the horizontal plane 
projected down to the xy-plane. So if you draw the level curves of a function and visualf

Visual 14.1A animates Figure 11 by 
showing level curves being lifted up to 
graphs of functions. 

ize them being lifted up to the surface at the indicated height, then you can mentally piece 
together a picture of the graph. The surface is steep where the level curves are close 
together. It is somewhat flatter where they are farther apart. 

One common example of level curves occurs in topographic maps of mountainous 
regions, such as the map in Figure 12. The level curves are curves of constant elevation 
above sea level. If you walk along one of these contour lines you neither ascend nor descend. 
Another common example is the temperature function introduced in the opening paragraph 
of this section. Here the level curves are called isothermals and join locations with the 
same temperature. Figure 13 shows a weather map of the world indicating the average 
January temperatures. The isothermals are the curves that separate the colored bands.

of h (an elliptic paraboloid) where they become horizontal traces. We see from Figure 17 
how the graph of h is put together from the level curves. 
EXAMPLE 13 Plot level curves for the Cobb-Douglas production function of 
Example 3. 
SOLUTION In Figure 18 we use a computer to draw a contour plot for the Cobb-Douglas 
production function 
Level curves are labeled with the value of the production P. For instance, the level curve 
labeled 140 shows all values of the labor L and capital investment K that result in a production 
of P  140. We see that, for a fixed value of P, as L increases K decreases, and 
vice versa. 
For some purposes, a contour map is more useful than a graph. That is certainly true in 
Example 13. (Compare Figure 18 with Figure 8.) It is also true in estimating function values, 
as in Example 9.

Functions of Three or More Variables 
A function of three variables, , is a rule that assigns to each ordered triple in a 
domain a unique real number denoted by . For instance, the temperature 
at a point on the surface of the Earth depends on the longitude x and latitude y of the 
point and on the time t, so we could write .

SECTION 14.1 FUNCTIONS OF SEVERAL VARIABLES .... 897 
It’s very difficult to visualize a function of three variables by its graph, since that 
would lie in a four-dimensional space. However, we do gain some insight into by examining 
its level surfaces, which are the surfaces with equations , where is 
a constant. If the point moves along a level surface, the value of remains 
fixed. 
EXAMPLE 15 Find the level surfaces of the function 
SOLUTION The level surfaces are , where . These form a family 
of concentric spheres with radius . (See Figure 20.) Thus, as varies over any 
sphere with center , the value of remains fixed. 
Functions of any number of variables can also be considered. A function of n variables 
is a rule that assigns a number to an -tuple of real 
numbers. We denote by the set of all such n-tuples. For example, if a company uses 
different ingredients in making a food product, is the cost per unit of the ith ingredient, 
and units of the ith ingredient are used, then the total cost of the ingredients is a function 
of the variables : 
The function is a real-valued function whose domain is a subset of . Sometimes we 
will use vector notation to write such functions more compactly: If , 
we often write in place of . With this notation we can rewrite the 
function defined in Equation 3 as 
where and denotes the dot product of the vectors c and x in . 
In view of the one-to-one correspondence between points in and 
their position vectors in , we have three ways of looking at a function 
defined on a subset of : 
1. As a function of real variables 
2. As a function of a single point variable 
3. As a function of a single vector variable 
We will see that all three points of view are useful.

The temperature-humidity index I (or humidex, for short) is the Duration (hours) 
perceived air temperature when the actual temperature is T and 
the relative humidity is h, so we can write I  f T, h. The following 
table of values of I is an excerpt from a table compiled 
by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Tables 1 and 2 show values of f x, y and tx, y, correct to three decimal places, for 
points x, y near the origin. (Notice that neither function is defined at the origin.) It 
appears that as x, y approaches (0, 0), the values of f x, y are approaching 1 whereas the 
values of tx, y aren’t approaching any number. It turns out that these guesses based on 
numerical evidence are correct, and we write 

sinx2 y2  x2 y2 

lim 2  1 and lim 2 does not exist 

 x, y l  0, 0 x2 y x, y l  0, 0 x2 y

In general, we use the notation 
lim f x, y  L 

 x, y l  a, b 

to indicate that the values of f x, y approach the number L as the point x, y approaches 
the point a, b along any path that stays within the domain of f . In other words, we can 
make the values of f x, y as close to L as we like by taking the point x, y sufficiently 
close to the point a, b, but not equal to a, b. A more precise definition follows. 

1 
Definition Let f be a function of two variables whose domain D includes points 

arbitrarily close to a, b. Then we say that the limit of f x, y as x, y 
approaches a, b is L and we write 

lim f x, y  L 

x, y l a, b 

if for every number 
0 there is a corresponding number 

0 such that 
 f x, y L  
 whenever x, y  D and 0 sx a2 y b2 


SECTION 14.2 LIMITS AND CONTINUITY .... 903 

Other notations for the limit in Definition 1 are 

lim f x, y  L and f x, y l L as x, y l a, b 

x l a 
y l b 


Notice that  f x, y L  is the distance between the numbers f x, y and L, and 
sx a 2  y b 2 is the distance between the point x, y and the point a, b. Thus, 
Definition 1 says that the distance between f  x, y and L can be made arbitrarily small by 
making the distance from x, y to a, b sufficiently small (but not 0). Figure 1 illustrates 
Definition 1 by means of an arrow diagram. If any small interval L 
, L 
 is given

Another illustration of Definition 1 is given in Figure 2 where the surface S is the graph

For functions of a single variable, when we let x approach a, there are only two pos


sible directions of approach, from the left or from the right. We recall from Chapter 2 that 

if limx l a f x  limx l a f  x, then limx l af x does not exist. 

For functions of two variables the situation is not as simple because we can let  x, y 

y 

approach a, b from an infinite number of directions in any manner whatsoever (see 
Figure 3) as long as x, y stays within the domain of f . 

Definition 1 says that the distance between f x, y and L can be made arbitrarily small 
by making the distance from x, y to a, b sufficiently small (but not 0). The definition 
refers only to the distance between x, y and a, b. It does not refer to the direction of 
approach. Therefore, if the limit exists, then f  x, y must approach the same limit no matter 
how  x, y approaches a, b. Thus, if we can find two different paths of approach along 


x2 y2 

EXAMPLE 1 Show that lim 2 does not exist.

SOLUTION Let f x, y   x2 y2 	 x2 y2 . First let’s approach 0, 0 along the x-axis. 
Then y  0 gives f x, 0  x2	x2  1 for all x  0, so

We now approach along the -axis by putting . Then for 
all , so 
(See Figure 4.) Since has two different limits along two different lines, the given limit 
does not exist. (This confirms the conjecture we made on the basis of numerical evidence 
at the beginning of this section.) 
EXAMPLE 2If , does exist? 
SOLUTION If , then . Therefore 
If , then , so 
Although we have obtained identical limits along the axes, that does not show that the 
given limit is 0. Let’s now approach along another line, say . For all , 
Therefore 
(See Figure 5.) Since we have obtained different limits along different paths, the given 
limit does not exist. 
Figure 6 sheds some light on Example 2. The ridge that occurs above the line corresponds 
to the fact that for all points on that line except the origin.

along any nonvertical line through the origin. Then , where

In Visual 14.2 a rotating line on the surface 
in Figure 6 shows different limits at 
the origin from different directions.

Thus, has the same limiting value along every nonvertical line through the origin. But 
that does not show that the given limit is 0, for if we now let along the 
parabola , we have 
so 
Since different paths lead to different limiting values, the given limit does not exist. 
Now let’s look at limits that do exist. Just as for functions of one variable, the calculation 
of limits for functions of two variables can be greatly simplified by the use of properties 
of limits. The Limit Laws listed in Section 2.3 can be extended to functions of two 
variables. The limit of a sum is the sum of the limits, the limit of a product is the product 
of the limits, and so on. In particular, the following equations are true. 
The Squeeze Theorem also holds. 
EXAMPLE 4 Find if it exists. 
SOLUTION As in Example 3, we could show that the limit along any line through the 
origin is 0. This doesn’t prove that the given limit is 0, but the limits along the parabolas 
and also turn out to be 0, so we begin to suspect that the limit does exist 
and is equal to 0. 
Let . We want to find such that 
that is, 
But since , so and therefore 
Thus, if we choose and let , then 
Hence, by Definition 1, 
Continuity 
Recall that evaluating limits of continuous functions of a single variable is easy. It can be 
accomplished by direct substitution because the defining property of a continuous function

is limx l af x  f a. Continuous functions of two variables are also defined by the direct 
substitution property. 

4 
Definition A function f of two variables is called continuous at a, b if 
lim f x, y  f a, b 

x, y l a, b 

We say f is continuous on D if f is continuous at every point a, b in D. 

The intuitive meaning of continuity is that if the point x, y changes by a small amount, 
then the value of f x, y changes by a small amount. This means that a surface that is the 
graph of a continuous function has no hole or break. 

Using the properties of limits, you can see that sums, differences, products, and quotients 
of continuous functions are continuous on their domains. Let’s use this fact to give 
examples of continuous functions. 

A polynomial function of two variables (or polynomial, for short) is a sum of terms 
of the form cxmyn, where c is a constant and m and n are nonnegative integers. A rational 
function is a ratio of polynomials. For instance, 

f x, y  x4  5x3y2  6xy4  7y  6 

is a polynomial, whereas 

2xy  1

tx, y  

2  y2

x

is a rational function. 

The limits in (2) show that the functions f x, y  x, tx, y  y, and hx, y  c are 
continuous. Since any polynomial can be built up out of the simple functions f , t, and h 
by multiplication and addition, it follows that all polynomials are continuous on .

2 

Likewise, any rational function is continuous on its domain because it is a quotient of continuous 
functions. 

EXAMPLE 5 Evaluate lim x2 y3  x3y2  3x  2y. 

x, y l 1, 2 

SOLUTION Since f x, y  x2 y3  x3y2  3x  2y is a polynomial, it is continuous everywhere, 
so we can find the limit by direct substitution: 

lim x2 y3  x3y2  3x  2y  12  23  13  22  3  1  2  2  11

EXAMPLE 6 Where is the function f x, y  2 continuous? 

x2  y

SOLUTION The function f is discontinuous at 0, 0 because it is not defined there. 
Since f is a rational function, it is continuous on its domain, which is the set 
D  x, yx, y  0, 0.

Here is defined at but is still discontinuous at 0 because 
does not exist (see Example 1). 
EXAMPLE 8 Let 
We know is continuous for since it is equal to a rational function there. 
Also, from Example 4, we have 
Therefore, is continuous at , and so it is continuous on . 
Just as for functions of one variable, composition is another way of combining two continuous 
functions to get a third. In fact, it can be shown that if is a continuous function 
of two variables and is a continuous function of a single variable that is defined on the 
range of , then the composite function defined by is also a 
continuous function. 
EXAMPLE 9 Where is the function continuous? 
SOLUTION The function is a rational function and therefore continuous 
except on the line . The function is continuous everywhere. So the 
composite function 
is continuous except where . The graph in Figure 9 shows the break in the graph of 
above the -axis. 
Functions of Three or More Variables 
Everything that we have done in this section can be extended to functions of three or more 
variables. The notation 
means that the values of approach the number L as the point approaches 
the point along any path in the domain of f. Because the distance between two 
points and in is given by , we can 
write the precise definition as follows: For every number there is a corresponding 
number such that 
and is in the domain of f. 
The function f is continuous at if

For instance, the function

origin and radius 1. 

If we use the vector notation introduced at the end of Section 14.1, then we can write 

the definitions of a limit for functions of two or three variables in a single compact form 

as follows.

On a hot day, extreme humidity makes us think the temperature is higher than it really 
is, whereas in very dry air we perceive the temperature to be lower than the thermometer 
indicates. The National Weather Service has devised the heat index (also called the 
temperature-humidity index, or humidex, in some countries) to describe the combined 
effects of temperature and humidity. The heat index I is the perceived air temperature when 
the actual temperature is T and the relative humidity is H. So I is a function of T and H and 
we can write I  f T, H. The following table of values of I is an excerpt from a table 
compiled by the National Weather Service.

If we concentrate on the highlighted column of the table, which corresponds to a relative 
humidity of H  70%, we are considering the heat index as a function of the single 
variable T for a fixed value of H. Let’s write tT f T, 70. Then tTdescribes how the 
heat index I increases as the actual temperature T increases when the relative humidity is 
70%. The derivative of t when T  96F is the rate of change of I with respect to T when

Averaging these values, we can say that the derivative t96is approximately 3.75. This 
means that, when the actual temperature is 96F and the relative humidity is 70%, the 
apparent temperature (heat index) rises by about 3.75F for every degree that the actual 
temperature rises! 

Now let’s look at the highlighted row in Table 1, which corresponds to a fixed temperature 
of T  96F. The numbers in this row are values of the function GH f 96, H, 
which describes how the heat index increases as the relative humidity H increases when 
the actual temperature is T  96F. The derivative of this function when H  70% is the 
rate of change of I with respect to H when H  70%:

By taking h  5 and 5, we approximate G70using the tabular values:

SECTION 14.3 PARTIAL DERIVATIVES .... 911 

By averaging these values we get the estimate G700.9. This says that, when the temperature 
is 96F and the relative humidity is 70%, the heat index rises about 0.9F for 
every percent that the relative humidity rises. 

In general, if f is a function of two variables x and y, suppose we let only x vary while 
keeping y fixed, say y  b, where b is a constant. Then we are really considering a function 
of a single variable x, namely, tx f x, b. If t has a derivative at a, then we call it 
the partial derivative of f with respect to x at a, band denote it by fxa, b. Thus 

1 
fxa, b ta where tx f x, b 

By the definition of a derivative, we have 

ta  h ta 

ta lim 

h l 0 h 

and so Equation 1 becomes 

2 
f a  h, b f a, b 

fxa, b lim 

h l 0 h 

Similarly, the partial derivative of f with respect to y at a, b, denoted by fya, b, is 
obtained by keeping x fixed x  aand finding the ordinary derivative at b of the function 
Gy f a, y: 

3 
f a, b  h f a, b 

fya, b lim 

h l 0 h 

With this notation for partial derivatives, we can write the rates of change of the heat 
index I with respect to the actual temperature T and relative humidity H when T  96F 
and H  70% as follows: 

fT96, 703.75 fH96, 700.9 

If we now let the point a, bvary in Equations 2 and 3, fx and fy become functions of 
two variables.

There are many alternative notations for partial derivatives. For instance, instead of 
fx we can write f1 or D1 f (to indicate differentiation with respect to the first variable) or 
fx. But here fx can’t be interpreted as a ratio of differentials. 

Notations for Partial Derivatives If z  fx, y, we write 
f z 

fxx, y  fx  fx, y  f1  D1 f  Dx f

To compute partial derivatives, all we have to do is remember from Equation 1 that 
the partial derivative with respect to x is just the ordinary derivative of the function t of a 
single variable that we get by keeping y fixed. Thus, we have the following rule. 

Rule for Finding Partial Derivatives of z  f x, y 

1. To find fx, regard y as a constant and differentiate fx, y with respect to x. 
2. To find fy, regard x as a constant and differentiate fx, y with respect to y.

SOLUTION Holding y constant and differentiating with respect to x, we get 
fxx, y  3x2  2xy3 
and so fx2, 1  3  22  2  2  13  16 
Holding x constant and differentiating with respect to y, we get 
fyx, y  3x2 y2  4y 
fy2, 1  3  22  12  4  1  8 

Interpretations of Partial Derivatives 

To give a geometric interpretation of partial derivatives, we recall that the equation 
z  fx, y represents a surface S (the graph of f ). If fa, b  c, then the point Pa, b, c 
lies on S. By fixing y  b, we are restricting our attention to the curve C1 in which the vertical 
plane y  b intersects S. (In other words, C1 is the trace of S in the plane y  b.) 
Likewise, the vertical plane x  a intersects S in a curve C2. Both of the curves C1 and C2 
pass through the point P. (See Figure 1.) 

Notice that the curve C1 is the graph of the function tx  fx, b, so the slope of its 
tangent T1 at P is ta  fxa, b. The curve C2 is the graph of the function Gy  fa, y, 
so the slope of its tangent T2 at P is Gb  fya, b. 

Thus, the partial derivatives fxa, b and fya, b can be interpreted geometrically as the 
slopes of the tangent lines at Pa, b, c to the traces C1 and C2 of S in the planes y  b 
and x  a. 


As we have seen in the case of the heat index function, partial derivatives can also be 
interpreted as rates of change. If , then represents the rate of change of 
with respect to when is fixed. Similarly, represents the rate of change of with 
respect to when is fixed. 
EXAMPLE 2If ,find and and interpret these numbers 
as slopes. 
SOLUTION We have 
The graph of is the paraboloid and the vertical plane intersects 
it in the parabola , . (As in the preceding discussion, we label 
it in Figure 2.) The slope of the tangent line to this parabola at the point is 
. Similarly, the curve in which the plane intersects the paraboloid 
is the parabola , , and the slope of the tangent line at is 
. (See Figure 3.) 
Figure 4 is a computer-drawn counterpart to Figure 2. Part (a) shows the plane 
intersecting the surface to form the curve and part (b) shows and . [We have used 
the vector equations for and for .] 
Similarly, Figure 5 corresponds to Figure 3.

Functions of More than Two Variables 

Partial derivatives can also be defined for functions of three or more variables. For example, 
if f is a function of three variables x, y, and z, then its partial derivative with respect to x 
is defined as 

fx  h, y, z  fx, y, z 

fxx, y, z  lim 

hl 0 h 

and it is found by regarding y and z as constants and differentiating fx, y, z with respect 
to x. If w  fx, y, z, then fx  wx can be interpreted as the rate of change of w with 
respect to x when y and z are held fixed. But we can’t interpret it geometrically because the 
graph of f lies in four-dimensional space. 

In general, if u is a function of n variables, u  fx1, x2, ..., xn, its partial derivative 
with respect to the ith variable xi is 

ufx1, ..., xi1, xi  h, xi1, ..., xn  fx1,..., xi, ..., xn

EXAMPLE 5 Find fx, fy, and fz if fx, y, z  exy ln z.

fx  yexy ln z

Similarly, fy  xexy ln z and fz 

Higher Derivatives 

If f is a function of two variables, then its partial derivatives fx and fy are also functions of 
two variables, so we can consider their partial derivatives  fxx,  fxy,  fyx, and  fyy, 
which are called the second partial derivatives of f. If z  fx, y, we use the following 
notation: 

2f 2z

 fxx  fxx  f11 

f  22

x x xx

2f 2z

 fyy  fyy  f22 

f  22y y yy

Thus, the notation fxy (or 2fyx) means that we first differentiate with respect to x and 
then with respect to y, whereas in computing fyx the order is reversed. 

EXAMPLE 6 Find the second partial derivatives of

Notice that in Example 6. This is not just a coincidence. It turns out that the 
mixed partial derivatives and are equal for most functions that one meets in practice. 
The following theorem, which was discovered by the French mathematician Alexis Clairaut

Partial Differential Equations 

Partial derivatives occur in partial differential equations that express certain physical laws. 
For instance, the partial differential equation 

2u 2u 

2  2  0 

xy

is called Laplace’s equation after Pierre Laplace (1749–1827). Solutions of this equation 
are called harmonic functions and play a role in problems of heat conduction, fluid flow, 
and electric potential. 

EXAMPLE 8 Show that the function ux, y  ex sin y is a solution of Laplace’s equation.

displacement of a vibrating violin string at time t and at a distance x from one end of the 
string (as in Figure 8), then ux, t satisfies the wave equation. Here the constant a depends 
on the density of the string and on the tension in the string.

The Cobb-Douglas Production Function 

In Example 3 in Section 14.1 we described the work of Cobb and Douglas in modeling the 
total production P of an economic system as a function of the amount of labor L and the 
capital investment K. Here we use partial derivatives to show how the particular form of 
their model follows from certain assumptions they made about the economy. 

If the production function is denoted by P  PL, K, then the partial derivative PL 
is the rate at which production changes with respect to the amount of labor. Economists 
call it the marginal production with respect to labor or the marginal productivity of labor. 
Likewise, the partial derivative PK is the rate of change of production with respect to 
capital and is called the marginal productivity of capital. In these terms, the assumptions 
made by Cobb and Douglas can be stated as follows. 

(i) If either labor or capital vanishes, then so will production. 
(ii) The marginal productivity of labor is proportional to the amount of production 
per unit of labor. 
(iii) The marginal productivity of capital is proportional to the amount of production 
per unit of capital. 
Because the production per unit of labor is PL, assumption (ii) says that 

P

If we solve this separable differential equation by the methods of Section 9.3 (see also

PL, K0   C1K0 L

Notice that we have written the constant C1 as a function of K0 because it could depend on 
the value of K0.

At the beginning of this section we discussed the function 
I  f T, H , where I is the heat index, T is the temperature, 
and H is the relative humidity. Use Table 1 to estimate 
fT 92, 60 and fH 92, 60. What are the practical interpretations 
of these values?

The wind-chill index W is the perceived temperature when the 
actual temperature is T and the wind speed is v, so we can 
write W  f T, v. The following table of values is an excerpt

The tangent plane contains the

One of the most important ideas in single-variable calculus is that as we zoom in toward a 
point on the graph of a differentiable function, the graph becomes indistinguishable from 
its tangent line and we can approximate the function by a linear function. (See Section 
3.11.) Here we develop similar ideas in three dimensions. As we zoom in toward a 
point on a surface that is the graph of a differentiable function of two variables, the surface 
looks more and more like a plane (its tangent plane) and we can approximate the function 
by a linear function of two variables. We also extend the idea of a differential to functions 
of two or more variables. 

Tangent Planes 

Suppose a surface S has equation z  f x, y, where f has continuous first partial derivatives, 
and let Px0, y0, z0  be a point on S. As in the preceding section, let C1 and C2 be the 
curves obtained by intersecting the vertical planes y  y0 and x  x0 with the surface S. 
Then the point P lies on both C1 and C2. Let T1 and T2 be the tangent lines to the curves C1 
and C2 at the point P. Then the tangent plane to the surface S at the point P is defined to 
be the plane that contains both tangent lines T1 and T2. (See Figure 1.) 

We will see in Section 14.6 that if C is any other curve that lies on the surface S and 
passes through P, then its tangent line at P also lies in the tangent plane. Therefore, you 
can think of the tangent plane to S at P as consisting of all possible tangent lines at P to 
curves that lie on S and pass through P. The tangent plane at P is the plane that most 
closely approximates the surface S near the point P. 

We know from Equation 12.5.7 that any plane passing through the point Px0, y0, z0  
has an equation of the form 

Ax  x0   By  y0   Cz  z0   0 

By dividing this equation by C and letting a  AC and b  BC, we can write it in 
the form 

1 
z  z0  ax  x0  by  y0  

If Equation 1 represents the tangent plane at P, then its intersection with the plane y  y0 
must be the tangent line T1. Setting y  y0 in Equation 1 gives 

z  z0  ax  x0  y  y0 

and we recognize these as the equations (in point-slope form) of a line with slope a. 
But from Section 14.3 we know that the slope of the tangent T1 is fxx0, y0 . Therefore, 
a  fxx0, y0 . 

Similarly, putting x  x0 in Equation 1, we get z  z0  by  y0 , which must represent 
the tangent line T2, so b  fyx0, y0 . 

|||| Note the similarity between the equation of 
a tangent plane and the equation of a tangent 
line:

Suppose f has continuous partial derivatives. An equation of the tangent plane 
to the surface z  f x, y at the point Px0, y0, z0  is 
z  z0  fxx0, y0 x  x0   fyx0, y0 y  y0 

Figure 2(a) shows the elliptic paraboloid and its tangent plane at (1, 1, 3) that we found 
in Example 1. In parts (b) and (c) we zoom in toward the point (1, 1, 3) by restricting the 
domain of the function . Notice that the more we zoom in, the flatter 
the graph appears and the more it resembles its tangent plane. 
In Figure 3 we corroborate this impression by zooming in toward the point (1, 1) on a 
contour map of the function . Notice that the more we zoom in, the 
more the level curves look like equally spaced parallel lines, which is characteristic of a 
plane.

SECTION 14.4 TANGENT PLANES AND LINEAR APPROXIMATIONS .... 925 
Linear Approximations 
In Example 1 we found that an equation of the tangent plane to the graph of the function 
at the point (1, 1, 3) is . Therefore, in view of the 
visual evidence in Figures 2 and 3, the linear function of two variables 
is a good approximation to when is near (1, 1). The function L is called the 
linearization of f at (1, 1) and the approximation 
is called the linear approximation or tangent plane approximation of f at (1, 1). 
For instance, at the point (1.1, 0.95) the linear approximation gives 
which is quite close to the true value of . But if 
we take a point farther away from (1, 1), such as (2, 3), we no longer get a good approximation. 
In fact, whereas . 
In general, we know from (2) that an equation of the tangent plane to the graph of a 
function f of two variables at the point is 
The linear function whose graph is this tangent plane, namely 
is called the linearization of f at and the approximation 
is called the linear approximation or the tangent plane approximation of at 
We have defined tangent planes for surfaces , where has continuous first 
partial derivatives. What happens if and are not continuous? Figure 4 pictures such a 
function; its equation is 
You can verify (see Exercise 42) that its partial derivatives exist at the origin and, in fact, 
and , but and are not continuous. The linear approximation 
would be , but at all points on the line . So a function of two 
variables can behave badly even though both of its partial derivatives exist. To rule out 
such behavior, we formulate the idea of a differentiable function of two variables. 
Recall that for a function of one variable, , if x changes from ato we

In Chapter 3 we showed that if is differentiable at a, then 
Now consider a function of two variables, , and suppose x changes from a to 
and y changes from b to . Then the corresponding increment of is 
Thus, the increment represents the change in the value of when changes from 
to . By analogy with (5) we define the differentiability of a function 
of two variables as follows. 
Definition If ,then is differentiableat if can be 
expressed in the form 
where and as . 
Definition 7 says that a differentiable function is one for which the linear approximation 
(4) is a good approximation when is near . In other words, the tangent 
plane approximates the graph of f well near the point of tangency. 
It’s sometimes hard to use Definition 7 directly to check the differentiability of a function, 
but the following theorem provides a convenient sufficient condition for differentiability. 
Theorem If the partial derivatives and exist near and are continuous 
at , then is differentiable at . 
EXAMPLE 2 Show that is differentiable at (1, 0) and find its linearization 
there. Then use it to approximate . 
SOLUTION The partial derivatives are 
Both and are continuous functions, so is differentiable by Theorem 8. The linearization 
is

EXAMPLE 3 At the beginning of Section 14.3 we discussed the heat index (perceived

gave the following table of values from the National Weather Service.

Find a linear approximation for the heat index I  fT, Hwhen T is near 96F and H is 
near 70%. Use it to estimate the heat index when the temperature is 97F and the relative 
humidity is 72%. 

SOLUTION We read from the table that f96, 70 125. In Section 14.3 we used the tabular 
values to estimate that fT96, 703.75 and fH96, 700.9. (See pages 910–911.) 
So the linear approximation is

In particular, 
f97, 72125  3.751 0.92 130.55 
Therefore, when T  97F and H  72%, the heat index is 
I 131F 

Differentials 

For a differentiable function of one variable, y  fx, we define the differential dx to be 
an independent variable; that is, dx can be given the value of any real number. The differential 
of y is then defined as 

9 
dy  fxdx 

(See Section 3.11.) Figure 6 shows the relationship between the increment y and the differential 
dy: y represents the change in height of the curve y  fxand dy represents the 
change in height of the tangent line when x changes by an amount dx  x. 

For a differentiable function of two variables, z  fx, y, we define the differentials 
dx and dy to be independent variables; that is, they can be given any values. Then the differential 
dz, also called the total differential, is defined by

If we take and in Equation 10, then the differential

So, in the notation of differentials, the linear approximation (4) can be written as 
Figure 7 is the three-dimensional counterpart of Figure 6 and shows the geometric interpretation 
of the differential and the increment : represents the change in height of 
the tangent plane, whereas represents the change in height of the surface

Functions of Three or More Variables 

Linear approximations, differentiability, and differentials can be defined in a similar manner 
for functions of more than two variables. A differentiable function is defined by an 
expression similar to the one in Definition 7. For such functions the linear approximation 
is 

fx, y, z fa, b, c fxa, b, cx a fya, b, cy b fza, b, cz c 

and the linearization Lx, y, z is the right side of this expression. 
If w  fx, y, z, then the increment of w is 

w  fx x, y y, z z fx, y, z 

The differential dw is defined in terms of the differentials dx, dy, and dz of the independent 
variables by

EXAMPLE 6 The dimensions of a rectangular box are measured to be 75 cm, 60 cm, 
and 40 cm, and each measurement is correct to within 0.2 cm. Use differentials to estimate 
the largest possible error when the volume of the box is calculated from these 
measurements. 

SOLUTION If the dimensions of the box are x, y, and z, its volume is V  xyz and so 

V V V 

dV  dx  dy  dz  yz dx xz dy xy dz 

x y z 

We are given that  x 	0.2,  y 	0.2, and  z  	0.2. To find the largest error in 
the volume, we therefore use dx  0.2, dy  0.2, and dz  0.2 together with x  75, 
y  60, and z  40:

 1980 

Thus, an error of only 0.2 cm in measuring each dimension could lead to an error of as 
much as 1980 cm3 in the calculated volume! This may seem like a large error, but it’s 
only about 1% of the volume of the box.

|||| 14.5 The Chain Rule 

Recall that the Chain Rule for functions of a single variable gives the rule for differentiating 
a composite function: If y  f x and x  tt, where f and t are differentiable functions, 
then y is indirectly a differentiable function of t and

dt dxdt 

For functions of more than one variable, the Chain Rule has several versions, each of 
them giving a rule for differentiating a composite function. The first version (Theorem 2) 
deals with the case where z  f x, y and each of the variables x and y is, in turn, a function 
of a variable t . This means that z is indirectly a function of t, z  f tt, ht, and the 
Chain Rule gives a formula for differentiating z as a function of t. We assume that f is differentiable 
(Definition 14.4.7). Recall that this is the case when fx and fy are continuous 
(Theorem 14.4.8).

Proof A change of t in t produces changes of x in x and y in y. These, in turn, produce 
a change of z in z, and from Definition 14.4.7 we have

defined at 0, 0, we can define them to be 0 there.] Dividing both sides of this equation

If we now let t l 0, then x  tt t tt l 0 because t is differentiable and 
therefore continuous. Similarly, y l 0. This, in turn, means that 1 l 0 and 2 l 0, so

Case 2 of the Chain Rule contains three types of variables: s and t are independent 
variables, x and y are called intermediate variables, and z is the dependent variable. 
Notice that Theorem 3 has one term for each intermediate variable and each of these terms 
resembles the one-dimensional Chain Rule in Equation 1. 

z To remember the Chain Rule it’s helpful to draw the tree diagram in Figure 2. We draw 

z z 

branches from the dependent variable z to the intermediate variables x and y to indicate

x y 

that z is a function of x and y. Then we draw branches from x and y to the independent 

xy 

variables s and t. On each branch we write the corresponding partial derivative. To find

FIGURE 2 z z x z y 

s x s y s 

Similarly, we find zt by using the paths from z to t. 

Now we consider the general situation in which a dependent variable u is a function of 
n intermediate variables x1, ..., xn, each of which is, in turn, a function of m independent 
variables t1, ..., tm. Notice that there are n terms, one for each intermediate variable. The 
proof is similar to that of Case 1.

The Chain Rule (General Version) Suppose that u is a differentiable function of the 
n variables x1, x2, ..., xn and each xj is a differentiable function of the m variables 
t1, t2, ..., tm. Then u is a function of t1, t2, ..., tm and

Implicit Differentiation 

The Chain Rule can be used to give a more complete description of the process of implicit 
differentiation that was introduced in Sections 3.6 and 14.3. We suppose that an equation 
of the form Fx, y  0 defines y implicitly as a differentiable function of x, that is, 
y  f x, where Fx, f x  0 for all x in the domain of f . If F is differentiable, we can 
apply Case 1 of the Chain Rule to differentiate both sides of the equation Fx, y  0 with 
respect to x. Since both x and y are functions of x, we obtain 

F dx F dy

  0 

x dx y dx 

But dxdx  1, so if Fy  0 we solve for dydx and obtain 

6 
F 
dy x Fx 


dx F Fy 
y 

To derive this equation we assumed that Fx, y  0 defines y implicitly as a function 
of x. The Implicit Function Theorem, proved in advanced calculus, gives conditions 
under which this assumption is valid. It states that if F is defined on a disk containing 
a, b, where Fa, b  0, Fya, b  0, and Fx and Fy are continuous on the disk, then the 
equation Fx, y  0 defines y as a function of x near the point a, b and the derivative of 
this function is given by Equation 6. 

EXAMPLE 8 Find y if x3  y3  6xy. 


SECTION 14.5 THE CHAIN RULE .... 937 

SOLUTION The given equation can be written as

dx Fy 3yy


Now we suppose that z is given implicitly as a function z  fx, y by an equation of 
the form Fx, y, z  0. This means that Fx, y, fx, y  0 for all x, y in the domain of 

f. If F and f are differentiable, then we can use the Chain Rule to differentiate the equation 
Fx, y, z  0 as follows: 
F x F y F z 

  0 

x x y x z x 

But 
x  1 and y  0 

x 
x 

so this equation becomes 

F F z 

  0 

x z x 

If Fz  0, we solve for zx and obtain the first formula in Equations 7. The formula 
for zy is obtained in a similar manner.

Again, a version of the Implicit Function Theorem gives conditions under which 
our assumption is valid. If F is defined within a sphere containing a, b, c, where 
Fa, b, c  0, Fza, b, c  0, and Fx, Fy, and Fz are continuous inside the sphere, then the 
equation Fx, y, z  0 defines z as a function of x and y near the point a, b, c and this 
function is differentiable, with partial derivatives given by (7).

The weather map in Figure 1 shows a contour map of the temperature function Tx, y for 
the states of California and Nevada at 3:00 P.M. on a day in October. The level curves, or 
isothermals, join locations with the same temperature. The partial derivative Tx at a location 
such as Reno is the rate of change of temperature with respect to distance if we travel 
east from Reno; Ty is the rate of change of temperature if we travel north. But what if we 
want to know the rate of change of temperature when we travel southeast (toward Las 
Vegas), or in some other direction? In this section we introduce a type of derivative, called 
a directional derivative, that enables us to find the rate of change of a function of two or 
more variables in any direction.

and represent the rates of change of z in the x- and y-directions, that is, in the directions of

the unit vectors i and j. 

Suppose that we now wish to find the rate of change of z at x0, y0  in the direction of 
FIGURE 2 an arbitrary unit vector u  	a, b
. (See Figure 2.) To do this we consider the surface S 
A unit vector u=ka, bl=kcos ¨, sin ¨l 
with equation z  f x, y (the graph of f ) and we let z0  f x0, y0 . Then the point 


SECTION 14.6 DIRECTIONAL DERIVATIVES AND THE GRADIENT VECTOR .... 941 

Px0, y0, z0  lies on S. The vertical plane that passes through P in the direction of u intersects 
S in a curve C. (See Figure 3.) The slope of the tangent line T to C at the point P is 
the rate of change of z in the direction of u. 


Visual 14.6A animates Figure 3 by 
rotating u and therefore T.

If Qx, y, z is another point on C and P, Q are the projections of P, Q on the xy-plane,

If we take the limit as h l 0, we obtain the rate of change of z (with respect to distance) 
in the direction of u, which is called the directional derivative of f in the direction of u.

vector is

if u  j  	0, 1

to x and y are just special cases of the directional derivative.

We approximate the directional derivative Du T by the average rate of change of the 
temperature between the points where this line intersects the isothermals T  50 and 
T  60. The temperature at the point southeast of Reno is T  60F and the temperature 
at the point northwest of Reno is T  50F. The distance between these points looks to 
be about 75 miles. So the rate of change of the temperature in the southeasterly direction

When we compute the directional derivative of a function defined by a formula, we generally

Comparing Equations 4 and 5, we see that 
If the unit vector makes an angle with the positive -axis (as in Figure 2), then we 
can write and the formula in Theorem 3 becomes

Therefore 
The Gradient Vector 
Notice from Theorem 3 that the directional derivative can be written as the dot product of 
two vectors: 
The first vector in this dot product occurs not only in computing directional derivatives but 
in many other contexts as well. So we give it a special name (the gradient of ) and a special 
notation (grad f or f , which is read “del f ”).

For functions of three variables we can define directional derivatives in a similar manner. 
Again Du fx, y, z can be interpreted as the rate of change of the function in the direction 
of a unit vector u.

x  x0  tu (Equation 12.5.1) and so fx0  hu represents the value of f at a point on

Maximizing the Directional Derivative 

Suppose we have a function f of two or three variables and we consider all possible directional 
derivatives of f at a given point. These give the rates of change of f in all possible 
directions. We can then ask the questions: In which of these directions does f change 
fastest and what is the maximum rate of change? The answers are provided by the following 
theorem. 

15 
Theorem Suppose f is a differentiable function of two or three variables. The 


Visual 14.6B provides visual confirmation 

of Theorem 15. 

maximum value of the directional derivative Du f x is  f x and it occurs when 

u has the same direction as the gradient vector f x. 
Proof From Equation 9 or 14 we have 

Du f  f  u 

f 

is 1 and this

u 

cos 

 f 

occurs when 

 0. Therefore, the maximum value of Du f is 
and it occurs when 

 0, that is, when u has the same direction as f .

By Theorem 15 the temperature increases fastest in the direction of the gradient vector

Therefore, the maximum rate of increase of temperature is . 
Tangent Planes to Level Surfaces 
Suppose is a surface with equation , that is, it is a level surface of a function 
of three variables, and let be a point on . Let be any curve that lies 
on the surface and passes through the point . Recall from Section 13.1 that the curve 
is described by a continuous vector function . Let be the parameter 
value corresponding to ; that is, . Since lies on , any point 
must satisfy the equation of , that is, 
If , , and are differentiable functions of and is also differentiable, then we can use 
the Chain Rule to differentiate both sides of Equation 16 as follows:

Fx0, y0, z0   rt0   0 

Equation 18 says that the gradient vector at P, Fx0, y0, z0 , is perpendicular to the 
rt0  to any curve C on S that passes through P. (See Figure 9.) If 
, it is therefore natural to define the tangent plane to the level surface 
at Px0, y0, z0  as the plane that passes through P and has normal vector 
Fx0, y0, z0 . Using the standard equation of a plane (Equation 12.5.7), we can write the 

FIGURE 9 equation of this tangent plane as 

Fxx0, y0, z0 x  x0   Fyx0, y0, z0 y  y0   Fzx0, y0, z0 z  z0   019 
The normal line to S at P is the line passing through P and perpendicular to the tangent 
plane. The direction of the normal line is therefore given by the gradient vector 
Fx0, y0, z0  and so, by Equation 12.5.3, its symmetric equations are

In the special case in which the equation of a surface S is of the form z  f x, y (that 
is, S is the graph of a function f of two variables), we can rewrite the equation as 
Fx, y, z  f x, y  z  0 
and regard S as a level surface (with k  0) of F. Then 
Fxx0, y0, z0   fxx0, y0  
Fyx0, y0, z0   fyx0, y0  
Fzx0, y0, z0   1 
so Equation 19 becomes 
fxx0, y0 x  x0   fyx0, y0 y  y0   z  z0   0 

which is equivalent to Equation 14.4.2. Thus, our new, more general, definition of a tangent 
plane is consistent with the definition that was given for the special case of Section 14.4.

Significance of the Gradient Vector 
We now summarize the ways in which the gradient vector is significant. We first consider 
a function of three variables and a point in its domain. On the one hand, we 
know from Theorem 15 that the gradient vector gives the direction of fastest 
increase of . On the other hand, we know that is orthogonal to the level surface 
of through . (Refer to Figure 9.) These two properties are quite compatible intuitively 
because as we move away from on the level surface , the value of does not 
change at all. So it seems reasonable that if we move in the perpendicular direction, we get 
the maximum increase. 
In like manner we consider a function of two variables and a point in its 
domain. Again the gradient vector gives the direction of fastest increase of . 
Also, by considerations similar to our discussion of tangent planes, it can be shown that 
is perpendicular to the level curve that passes through . Again this 
is intuitively plausible because the values of remain constant as we move along the 
curve. (See Figure 11.) 
If we consider a topographical map of a hill and let represent the height above 
sea level at a point with coordinates , then a curve of steepest ascent can be drawn as 
in Figure 12 by making it perpendicular to all of the contour lines. This phenomenon can 
also be noticed in Figure 12 in Section 14.1, where Lonesome Creek follows a curve of 
steepest descent.

|||| 14.7 Maximum and Minimum Values 
As we saw in Chapter 4, one of the main uses of ordinary derivatives is in finding maximum 
and minimum values. In this section we see how to use partial derivatives to locate 
maxima and minima of functions of two variables. In particular, in Example 6 we will see 
how to maximize the volume of a box without a lid if we have a fixed amount of cardboard 
to work with. 
Definition A function of two variables has a local maximum at if 
when is near . [This means that for 
all points in some disk with center .] The number is called a 
local maximum value. If when is near , then 
is a local minimum value. 
If the inequalities in Definition 1 hold for all points in the domain of , then has 
an absolute maximum (or absolute minimum) at . 
The graph of a function with several maxima and minima is shown in Figure 1. You can 
think of the local maxima as mountain peaks and the local minima as valley bottoms. 
Theorem If has a local maximum or minimum at and the first-order 
partial derivatives of exist there, then and . 
Proof Let . If has a local maximum (or minimum) at , then has a 
local maximum (or minimum) at , so by Fermat’s Theorem (see Theorem 4.1.4). 
But (see Equation 14.3.1) and so . Similarly, by applying 
Fermat’s Theorem to the function , we obtain . 
If we put and in the equation of a tangent plane (Equation 
14.4.2), we get . Thus, the geometric interpretation of Theorem 2 is that if the graph 
of has a tangent plane at a local maximum or minimum, then the tangent plane must be 
horizontal.

A point is called a critical point (or stationary point) of if and 
, or if one of these partial derivatives does not exist. Theorem 2 says that if 
has a local maximum or minimum at , then is a critical point of . However, as 
in single-variable calculus, not all critical points give rise to maxima or minima. At a critical 
point, a function could have a local maximum or a local minimum or neither. 
EXAMPLE 1Let . Then 
These partial derivatives are equal to 0 when and , so the only critical point 
is . By completing the square, we find that 
Since and , we have for all values of and . 
Therefore, is a local minimum, and in fact it is the absolute minimum of . 
This can be confirmed geometrically from the graph of which is the elliptic paraboloid 
with vertex shown in Figure 2. 
EXAMPLE 2 Find the extreme values of . 
SOLUTION Since and , the only critical point is . Notice that 
for points on the -axis we have , so (if ). However, for 
points on the -axis we have , so (if ). Thus, every disk 
with center contains points where takes positive values as well as points where 
takes negative values. Therefore, can’t be an extreme value for , so has 
no extreme value. 
Example 2 illustrates the fact that a function need not have a maximum or minimum 
value at a critical point. Figure 3 shows how this is possible. The graph of is the hyperbolic 
paraboloid , which has a horizontal tangent plane ( ) at the origin. 
You can see that is a maximum in the direction of the -axis but a minimum 
in the direction of the -axis. Near the origin the graph has the shape of a saddle and so 
is called a saddle point of . 
We need to be able to determine whether or not a function has an extreme value at a 
critical point. The following test, which is proved at the end of this section, is analogous 
to the Second Derivative Test for functions of one variable. 
Second Derivatives Test Suppose the second partial derivatives of are continuous 
on a disk with center , and suppose that and 
[that is, is a critical point of ]. Let 
(a) If and , then is a local minimum. 
(b) If and , then is a local maximum. 
(c) If , then is not a local maximum or minimum.

EXAMPLE 3 Find the local maximum and minimum values and saddle points of

SOLUTION We first locate the critical points: 
Setting these partial derivatives equal to 0, we obtain the equations 
To solve these equations we substitute from the first equation into the second 
one. This gives 
so there are three real roots: , , . The three critical points are , , 
and . 
Next we calculate the second partial derivatives and : 
Since , it follows from case (c) of the Second Derivatives Test that 
the origin is a saddle point; that is, has no local maximum or minimum at . 
Since and , we see from case (a) of the test that 
is a local minimum. Similarly, we have and 
, so is also a local minimum.

From Equation 4 we see that either 

x  0or 10y  5  2x2  0 

In the first case (x  0), Equation 5 becomes 4y1  y2   0, so y  0 and we 
have the critical point 0, 0. 
In the second case 10y  5  2x2  0, we get

Using a graphing calculator or computer to graph the function 

ty  4y3  21y  12.5 

as in Figure 6, we see that Equation 7 has three real roots. By zooming in, we can find 
the roots to four decimal places: 

y  2.5452 y  0.6468 y  1.8984 

(Alternatively, we could have used Newton’s method or a rootfinder to locate these 
roots.) From Equation 6, the corresponding x-values are given by 

x  s5y  2.5 

If y  2.5452, then x has no corresponding real values. If y  0.6468, then 
x  0.8567. If y  1.8984, then x  2.6442. So we have a total of five critical 
points, which are analyzed in the following chart. All quantities are rounded to two 
decimal places.

EXAMPLE 6 A rectangular box without a lid is to be made from 12 m2 of cardboard. Find

SOLUTION Let the length, width, and height of the box (in meters) be x, y, and z, as shown 
in Figure 10. Then the volume of the box is 

V  xyz 

We can express V as a function of just two variables x and y by using the fact that the 
area of the four sides and the bottom of the box is 

2xz  2yz  xy  12 

Solving this equation for z, we get z  12  xy2x  y, so the expression for V

If V is a maximum, then Vx  Vy  0, but x  0 or y  0 gives V  0, so we 
must solve the equations 

12  2xy  x2  0 12  2xy  y2  0 

These imply that x2  y2 and so x  y. (Note that x and y must both be positive in this 
problem.) If we put x  y in either equation we get 12  3x2  0, which gives x  2, 
y  2, and z  12  2  222  2  1. 

We could use the Second Derivatives Test to show that this gives a local maximum 
of V, or we could simply argue from the physical nature of this problem that there must 
be an absolute maximum volume, which has to occur at a critical point of V, so it must 
occur when x  2, y  2, z  1. Then V  2  2  1  4, so the maximum volume of

Absolute Maximum and Minimum Values 

For a function f of one variable the Extreme Value Theorem says that if f is continuous 
on a closed interval a, b, then f has an absolute minimum value and an absolute maximum 
value. According to the Closed Interval Method in Section 4.1, we found these by 
evaluating f not only at the critical numbers but also at the endpoints a and b. 

There is a similar situation for functions of two variables. Just as a closed interval contains 
its endpoints, a closed set in 2 is one that contains all its boundary points. [A boundary 
point of D is a point a, b such that every disk with center a, b contains points in D 
and also points not in D.] For instance, the disk 

D  	x, y x2  y2  1
 

which consists of all points on and inside the circle x2  y2  1, is a closed set because it 
contains all of its boundary points (which are the points on the circle x2  y2  1). But if 
even one point on the boundary curve were omitted, the set would not be closed. (See 
Figure 11.) 

A bounded set in 2 is one that is contained within some disk. In other words, it is 
finite in extent. Then, in terms of closed and bounded sets, we can state the following counterpart 
of the Extreme Value Theorem in two dimensions. 

Extreme Value Theorem for Functions of Two Variables If is continuous on a closed,

To find the extreme values guaranteed by Theorem 8, we note that, by Theorem 2, if f 
has an extreme value at x1, y1, then x1, y1 is either a critical point of f or a boundary 
point of D. Thus, we have the following extension of the Closed Interval Method. 

To find the absolute maximum and minimum values of a continuous function 
on a closed, bounded set : 
1. Find the values of at the critical points of in . 
2. Find the extreme values of on the boundary of . 
3. The largest of the values from steps 1 and 2 is the absolute maximum value; 
the smallest of these values is the absolute minimum value.

SOLUTION Since f is a polynomial, it is continuous on the closed, bounded rectangle D, 
so Theorem 8 tells us there is both an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum. 
According to step 1 in (9), we first find the critical points. These occur when 

fx  2x  2y  0 fy  2x  2  0 

so the only critical point is 1, 1, and the value of f there is f1, 1  1.

In step 2 we look at the values of on the boundary of , which consists of the four 
line segments , , , shown in Figure 12. On we have and 
This is an increasing function of , so its minimum value is and its maximum 
value is . On we have and 
This is a decreasing function of , so its maximum value is and its minimum 
value is . On we have and 
By the methods of Chapter 4, or simply by observing that , we see 
that the minimum value of this function is and the maximum value is 
. Finally, on we have and 
with maximum value and minimum value . Thus, on the boundary, 
the minimum value of is 0 and the maximum is 9. 
In step 3 we compare these values with the value at the critical point and 
conclude that the absolute maximum value of on is and the absolute 
minimum value is . Figure 13 shows the graph of .

Quadratic Approximations and Critical Points 

The Taylor polynomial approximation to functions of one variable that we discussed in Chapter 
11 can be extended to functions of two or more variables. Here we investigate quadratic 
approximations to functions of two variables and use them to give insight into the Second 
Derivatives Test for classifying critical points. 

In Section 14.4 we discussed the linearization of a function f of two variables at a 
point a, b: 

Lx, y  fa, b  fxa, bx  a  fya, by  b 

Recall that the graph of L is the tangent plane to the surface z  fx, y at a, b, f a, b and the 
corresponding linear approximation is f x, y Lx, y. The linearization L is also called the 
first-degree Taylor polynomial of f at a, b.

If f has continuous second-order partial derivatives at a, b, then the second-degree Taylor 
polynomial of f at a, b is

and the approximation f x, y Qx, y is called the quadratic approximation to f at

It’s easier to explain the geometric basis of Lagrange’s method for functions of two 
variables. So we start by trying to find the extreme values of fx, y subject to a constraint 
of the form tx, y  k. In other words, we seek the extreme values of fx, y when the 
point x, y is restricted to lie on the level curve tx, y  k. Figure 1 shows this curve 
together with several level curves of f. These have the equations fx, y  c, where c  7, 
8, 9, 10, 11. To maximize fx, y subject to tx, y  k is to find the largest value of c such 
that the level curve fx, y  c intersects tx, y  k. It appears from Figure 1 that this 
happens when these curves just touch each other, that is, when they have a common tangent 
line. (Otherwise, the value of c could be increased further.) This means that the normal 
lines at the point x0, y0  where they touch are identical. So the gradient vectors are 

parallel; that is,

This kind of argument also applies to the problem of finding the extreme values of 
fx, y, z subject to the constraint tx, y, z  k. Thus, the point x, y, z is restricted to lie 
on the level surface S with equation tx, y, z  k. Instead of the level curves in Figure 1, 
we consider the level surfaces fx, y, z  c and argue that if the maximum value of f 
is fx0, y0, z0   c, then the level surface fx, y, z  c is tangent to the level surface 
tx, y, z  k and so the corresponding gradient vectors are parallel. 

This intuitive argument can be made precise as follows. Suppose that a function f has 
an extreme value at a point Px0, y0, z0  on the surface S and let C be a curve with vector 
equation rt  xt, yt, zt that lies on S and passes through P. If t0 is the parameter 
value corresponding to the point P, then rt0  x0, y0, z0 . The composite function 
ht  fxt, yt, zt represents the values that f takes on the curve C. Since f has an 
extreme value at x0, y0, z0 , it follows that h has an extreme value at t0, so ht0  0. But 
if f is differentiable, we can use the Chain Rule to write 

0  ht0   fxx0, y0, z0 xt0   fyx0, y0, z0 yt0   fzx0, y0, z0 zt0  

 fx0, y0, z0   rt0 

This shows that the gradient vector fx0, y0, z0  is orthogonal to the tangent vector rt0  
to every such curve C. But we already know from Section 14.6 that the gradient vector 
of t, tx0, y0, z0 , is also orthogonal to rt0 . (See Equation 14.6.18.) This means that

the gradient vectors fx0, y0, z0  and tx0, y0, z0  must be parallel. Therefore, if

The number

Equation 1 is as follows. 

Method of Lagrange Multipliers To find the maximum and minimum values of 
fx, y, z subject to the constraint tx, y, z  k [assuming that these extreme 
values exist and t  0 on the surface tx, y, z  k]: 

such that

(a) Find all values of , y, z, and

. 


For functions of two variables the method of Lagrange multipliers is similar to the 
method just described. To find the extreme values of fx, y subject to the constraint 

tx, y  k, we look for values of x, y, and 

such that 

fx, y 

Our first illustration of Lagrange’s method is to reconsider the problem given in 
Example 6 in Section 14.7.

the maximum volume of such a box.

There are no general rules for solving systems of equations. Sometimes some ingenuity 
is required. In the present example you might notice that if we multiply (2) by x, (3) by y, 
and (4) by z, then the left sides of these equations will be identical. Doing this, we have

We observe that

2xz  xy  2yz  xy 

which gives xz  yz. But z  0 (since z  0 would give V  0), so x  y. From (7) and 

(8) we have 
2yz  xy  2xz  2yz 
which gives 2xz  xy and so (since x  0) y  2z. If we now put x  y  2z in (5),

Therefore, the maximum value of f on the circle x2  y2  1 is f 0, 1  2 and the 
minimum value is f 1, 0  1. Checking with Figure 2, we see that these values look 
reasonable. 

EXAMPLE 3 Find the extreme values of f x, y  x2  2y2 on the disk x2  y2  1. 

SOLUTION According to the procedure in (14.7.9), we compare the values of f at the critical 
points with values at the points on the boundary. Since fx  2x and fy  4y, the only 
critical point is 0, 0. We compare the value of f at that point with the extreme values 
on the boundary from Example 2:

Therefore, the maximum value of f on the disk x2  y2  1 is f 0, 1  2 and the 
minimum value is f 0, 0  0.

These values of then give the corresponding points :

It’s easy to see that has a smaller value at the first of these points, so the closest point 
is and the farthest is . 
Two Constraints 
Suppose now that we want to find the maximum and minimum values of a function 
subject to two constraints (side conditions) of the form and 
. Geometrically, this means that we are looking for the extreme values of 
when is restricted to lie on the curve of intersection of the level surfaces 
and . (See Figure 5.) Suppose has such an extreme value at a 
point . We know from the beginning of this section that is orthogonal to 
there. But we also know that is orthogonal to and is orthogonal to 
, so and are both orthogonal to . This means that the gradient vector 
is in the plane determined by and . (We assume 
that these gradient vectors are not zero and not parallel.) So there are numbers and 
(called Lagrange multipliers) such that 
In this case Lagrange’s method is to look for extreme values by solving five equations in 
the five unknowns , , , , and . These equations are obtained by writing Equation 16

Rocket Science 

Many rockets, such as the Pegasus XL currently used to launch satellites and the Saturn V that 
first put men on the Moon, are designed to use three stages in their ascent into space. A large first 
stage initially propels the rocket until its fuel is consumed, at which point the stage is jettisoned 
to reduce the mass of the rocket. The smaller second and third stages function similarly in order 
to place the rocket’s payload into orbit about the Earth. (With this design, at least two stages are 
required in order to reach the necessary velocities, and using three stages has proven to be a good 
compromise between cost and performance.) Our goal here is to determine the individual masses 
of the three stages to be designed in such a way as to minimize the total mass of the rocket while 
enabling it to reach a desired velocity. 

For a single-stage rocket consuming fuel at a constant rate, the change in velocity resulting 
from the acceleration of the rocket vehicle has been modeled by 

1  SMr

V  c ln1  

P  Mr 

where Mr is the mass of the rocket engine including initial fuel, P is the mass of the payload, S is 
a structural factor determined by the design of the rocket (specifically, it is the ratio of the mass 
of the rocket vehicle without fuel to the total mass of the rocket with payload), and c is the (constant) 
speed of exhaust relative to the rocket. 

Now consider a rocket with three stages and a payload of mass A. Assume that outside forces 
are negligible and that c and S remain constant for each stage. If Mi is the mass of the ith stage, 
we can initially consider the rocket engine to have mass M1 and its payload to have mass 
M2  M3  A; the second and third stages can be handled similarly. 

1. 
Show that the velocity attained after all three stages have been jettisoned is given by 
M1  M2  M3  AM2  M3  AM3  A 

vf  c	ln. 
 ln ln 


SM1  M2  M3  A SM2  M3  A SM3  A 

2. 
We wish to minimize the total mass M  M1  M2  M3 of the rocket engine subject 
to the constraint that the desired velocity vf from Problem 1 is attained. The method of 
Lagrange multipliers is appropriate here, but difficult to implement using the current expressions. 
To simplify, we define variables Ni so that the constraint equation may be expressed as 
vf  cln N1  ln N2  ln N3 . Since M is now difficult to express in terms of the Ni ’s, we 
wish to use a simpler function that will be minimized at the same place as M. Show that 
M1  M2  M3  A 1  S N1 

M2  M3  A 1  SN1

5. 
If we want to put a three-stage rocket into orbit 100 miles above the Earth’s surface, a final 
velocity of approximately 17,500 mih is required. Suppose that each stage is built with a 
structural factor S  0.2 and an exhaust speed of c  6000 mih. 
(a) Find the minimum total mass M of the rocket engines as a function of A. 
(b) Find the mass of each individual stage as a function of A. (They are not equally sized!) 
6. 
The same rocket would require a final velocity of approximately 24,700 mih in order to 
escape Earth’s gravity. Find the mass of each individual stage that would minimize the total 
mass of the rocket engines and allow the rocket to propel a 500-pound probe into deep space. 
APPLIED PROJECT 

Hydro-Turbine Optimization 

The Great Northern Paper Company in Millinocket, Maine, operates a hydroelectric generating 
station on the Penobscot River. Water is piped from a dam to the power station. The rate at which 
the water flows through the pipe varies, depending on external conditions. 

The power station has three different hydroelectric turbines, each with a known (and unique) 
power function that gives the amount of electric power generated as a function of the water flow 
arriving at the turbine. The incoming water can be apportioned in different volumes to each 
turbine, so the goal is to determine how to distribute water among the turbines to give the maximum 
total energy production for any rate of flow. 

Using experimental evidence and Bernoulli’s equation, the following quadratic models were 
determined for the power output of each turbine, along with the allowable flows of operation:

where 
Qi  flow through turbine i in cubic feet per second 
KWi  power generated by turbine i in kilowatts 
QT  total flow through the station in cubic feet per second 

1. 
If all three turbines are being used, we wish to determine the flow Qi to each turbine that will 
give the maximum total energy production. Our limitations are that the flows must sum to 
the total incoming flow and the given domain restrictions must be observed. Consequently, 
use Lagrange multipliers to find the values for the individual flows (as functions of QT) 
that maximize the total energy production KW1  KW2  KW3 subject to the constraints 
Q1  Q2  Q3  QT and the domain restrictions on each Qi. 
2. 
For which values of QT is your result valid? 
3. 
For an incoming flow of 2500 ft3s, determine the distribution to the turbines and verify (by 
trying some nearby distributions) that your result is indeed a maximum.

CHAPTER 14 PARTIAL DERIVATIVES 

4. 
Until now we assumed that all three turbines are operating; is it possible in some situations 
that more power could be produced by using only one turbine? Make a graph of the three 
power functions and use it to help decide if an incoming flow of 1000 ft3s should be distributed 
to all three turbines or routed to just one. (If you determine that only one turbine 
should be used, which one?) What if the flow is only 600 ft3s? 
5. 
Perhaps for some flow levels it would be advantageous to use two turbines. If the incoming 
flow is 1500 ft3s, which two turbines would you recommend using? Use Lagrange multipliers 
to determine how the flow should be distributed between the two turbines to maximize 
the energy produced. For this flow, is using two turbines more efficient than using 
all three? 
6. 
If the incoming flow is 3400 ft3s, what would you recommend to the company?

If we approximate a solid by rectangular columns 
(Chapter) 
and let the number of columns increase, the

Multiple Integrals 




In this chapter we extend the idea of a definite integral to double 
and triple integrals of functions of two or three variables. These 
ideas are then used to compute volumes, surface areas, masses, 

and centroids of more general regions than we were able to consider 
in Chapters 6 and 8. We also use double integrals to calculate 
probabilities when two random variables are involved. 

|||| 15.1 Double Integrals over Rectangles 

In much the same way that our attempt to solve the area problem led to the definition of a 
definite integral, we now seek to find the volume of a solid and in the process we arrive at 
the definition of a double integral. 

Review of the Definite Integral 

First let’s recall the basic facts concerning definite integrals of functions of a single variable. 
If f x is defined for a  x  b, we start by dividing the interval a, b into n subintervals 
xi1, xi  of equal width x  b  a
n and we choose sample points x* i in these 
subintervals. Then we form the Riemann sum 

n

and take the limit of such sums as n l  to obtain the definite integral of f from a to b:

i1 

In the special case where f x  0, the Riemann sum can be interpreted as the sum of the 
areas of the approximating rectangles in Figure 1, and xab f x dx represents the area under 
the curve y  f x from a to b.

S  x, y, z  3  0  z  fx, y, x, y  R 

(See Figure 2.) Our goal is to find the volume of S. 

The first step is to divide the rectangle R into subrectangles. We do this by dividing the 
interval a, b into m subintervals xi1, xi of equal width x  b  a
m and dividing 
c, d into n subintervals  yj1, yj of equal width y  d  c
n. By drawing lines parallel 
to the coordinate axes through the endpoints of these subintervals as in Figure 3, we 
form the subrectangles

If we choose a sample point xij *, yij * in each Rij, then we can approximate the part of 
S that lies above each Rij by a thin rectangular box (or “column”) with base Rij and height

and the definition of a single integral in

SECTION 15.1 DOUBLE INTEGRALS OVER RECTANGLES .... 983

(See Figure 5.) This double sum means that for each subrectangle we evaluate f at the chosen 
point and multiply by the area of the subrectangle, and then we add the results.

become larger and so we would expect that

We use the expression in Equation 4 to define the volume of the solid S that lies under the 
graph of f and above the rectangle R. (It can be shown that this definition is consistent with 
our formula for volume in Section 6.2.) 

Limits of the type that appear in Equation 4 occur frequently, not just in finding volumes 
but in a variety of other situations as well—as we will see in Section 15.5—even 
when f is not a positive function. So we make the following definition.

It can be proved that the limit in Definition 5 exists if f is a continuous function. (It also 
exists for some discontinuous functions as long as they are reasonably “well behaved.”) 

The sample point xij *, yij * can be chosen to be any point in the subrectangle Rij, but if 
we choose it to be the upper right-hand corner of Rij [namely xi, yj, see Figure 3], then 
the expression for the double integral looks simpler:

984 .... CHAPTER 15 MULTIPLE INTEGRALS 
The sum in Definition 5, 
is called a double Riemann sum and is used as an approximation to the value of the 
double integral. [Notice how similar it is to the Riemann sum in (1) for a function of a 
single variable.] If happens to be a positive function, then the double Riemann sum 
represents the sum of volumes of columns, as in Figure 5, and is an approximation to the 
volume under the graph of . 
EXAMPLE 1 Estimate the volume of the solid that lies above the square 
and below the elliptic paraboloid . Divide into four equal squares 
and choose the sample point to be the upper right corner of each square . Sketch the 
solid and the approximating rectangular boxes. 
SOLUTION The squares are shown in Figure 6. The paraboloid is the graph of 
and the area of each square is 1. Approximating the volume 
by the Riemann sum with , we have 
This is the volume of the approximating rectangular boxes shown in Figure 7. 
We get better approximations to the volume in Example 1 if we increase the number of 
squares. Figure 8 shows how the columns start to look more like the actual solid and the 
corresponding approximations become more accurate when we use 16, 64, and 256 
squares. In the next section we will be able to show that the exact volume is 48.

SOLUTION It would be very difficult to evaluate this integral directly from Definition 5 but, 
because s1  x2  0, we can compute the integral by interpreting it as a volume. If 
z  s1  x2, then x2  z2  1 and z  0, so the given double integral represents the 
volume of the solid S that lies below the circular cylinder x2  z2  1 and above the 
rectangle R. (See Figure 9.) The volume of S is the area of a semicircle with radius 1 
times the length of the cylinder. Thus

The Midpoint Rule 

The methods that we used for approximating single integrals (the Midpoint Rule, the 
Trapezoidal Rule, Simpson’s Rule) all have counterparts for double integrals. Here we 
consider only the Midpoint Rule for double integrals. This means that we use a double 
Riemann sum to approximate the double integral, where the sample point xij *, yij * in Rij is 
chosen to be the center xi, yj of Rij. In other words, xi is the midpoint of xi1, xi  and yj 
is the midpoint of yj1, yj .

state of Colorado on December 24, 1982. (The state is in the shape of a rectangle that 
measures 388 mi west to east and 276 mi south to north.) Use the contour map to estimate

Recall that it is usually difficult to evaluate single integrals directly from the definition of 
an integral, but the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus provides a much easier method. The 
evaluation of double integrals from first principles is even more difficult, but in this section 
we see how to express a double integral as an iterated integral, which can then be evaluated 
by calculating two single integrals.

Suppose that f is a function of two variables that is continuous on the rectangle 
R  a, b	  c, d	. We use the notation xcd f x, y dy to mean that x is held fixed and 
f x, y is integrated with respect to y from y  c to y  d. This procedure is called partial 
integration with respect to y. (Notice its similarity to partial differentiation.) Now 
cd f x, y dy is a number that depends on the value of x, so it defines a function of x: 

Ax  y df x, y dy 

c 

If we now integrate the function A with respect to x from x  a to x  b, we get 

b bd 

1 y Ax dx  y y f x, y dydx

The integral on the right side of Equation 1 is called an iterated integral. Usually the 
brackets are omitted. Thus 

bd bd 

2 yy f x, y dy dx  y y f x, y dydx 
ac ac 

means that we first integrate with respect to y from c to d and then with respect to x from 
a to .

b 

Similarly, the iterated integral 

db db 

3 yy f x, y dx dy  y y f x, y dxdy 
ca ca 

means that we first integrate with respect to x (holding y fixed) from x  a to x  b and 
then we integrate the resulting function of y with respect to y from y  c to y  d. Notice 
that in both Equations 2 and 3 we work from the inside out.

Notice that in Example 1 we obtained the same answer whether we integrated with 
respect to y or x first. In general, it turns out (see Theorem 4) that the two iterated integrals 
in Equations 2 and 3 are always equal; that is, the order of integration does not matter. 
(This is similar to Clairaut’s Theorem on the equality of the mixed partial derivatives.) 

The following theorem gives a practical method for evaluating a double integral by 
expressing it as an iterated integral (in either order).

Fubini’s Theorem If f is continuous on the rectangle

bd db

More generally, this is true if we assume that f is bounded on R, f is discontinuous 
only on a finite number of smooth curves, and the iterated integrals exist. 

The proof of Fubini’s Theorem is too difficult to include in this book, but we can at least 
give an intuitive indication of why it is true for the case where fx, y  0. Recall that 
if f is positive, then we can interpret the double integral xxRfx, y dA as the volume V of 
the solid S that lies above R and under the surface z  fx, y. But we have another formula 
that we used for volume in Chapter 6, namely, 

V  y bAx dx 

a 

where Ax is the area of a cross-section of S in the plane through x perpendicular to the 
x-axis. From Figure 1 you can see that Ax is the area under the curve C whose equation 
is z  fx, y, where x is held constant and c  y  d. Therefore

when we evaluate double integrals it is 
wise to choose the order of integration that gives

|||| 15.3 Double Integrals over General Regions 

For single integrals, the region over which we integrate is always an interval. But for 
double integrals, we want to be able to integrate a function f not just over rectangles but 
also over regions D of more general shape, such as the one illustrated in Figure 1. We suppose 
that D is a bounded region, which means that D can be enclosed in a rectangular 
region R as in Figure 2. Then we define a new function F with domain R by

If the double integral of F exists over R, then we define the double integral of f over 
D by 

2 
yyf x, y dA  yyFx, y dA where F is given by Equation 1 

DR 

Definition 2 makes sense because R is a rectangle and so xxRFx, y dA has been previously 
defined in Section 15.1. The procedure that we have used is reasonable because the 
values of Fx, y are 0 when x, y lies outside D and so they contribute nothing to the integral. 
This means that it doesn’t matter what rectangle R we use as long as it contains D. 

In the case where f x, y  0 we can still interpret xxDf x, y dA as the volume of the 
solid that lies above D and under the surface z  f x, y (the graph of f ). You can see that 
this is reasonable by comparing the graphs of f and F in Figures 3 and 4 and remembering 
that xxRFx, y dA is the volume under the graph of F. 

Figure 4 also shows that F is likely to have discontinuities at the boundary points of 

D. Nonetheless, if f is continuous on D and the boundary curve of D is “well behaved” 
(in a sense outside the scope of this book), then it can be shown that xxRFx, y dA exists 
and therefore xxDf x, y dA exists. In particular, this is the case for the following types 
of regions. 
A plane region D is said to be of type I if it lies between the graphs of two continuous 
functions of x, that is, 

D  x, y a  x  b, t1x  y  t2x
 

where t1 and t2 are continuous on a, b	. Some examples of type I regions are shown in 
Figure 5.

FIGURE 5 Some type I regions 
In order to evaluate xxDf x, y dA when D is a region of type I, we choose a rectangle 
R  a, b	  c, d	 that contains D, as in Figure 6, and we let F be the function given by 

d 
0 x 
y 
bxa 
c

D 
y=g™(x) 
Equation 1; that is, F agrees with f on D and F is 0 outside D. Then, by Fubini’s Theorem, 
yyf x, y dA  yyFx, y dA  y b y dFx, y dy dx 

ac 

DR 

Observe that Fx, y  0 if y  t1x or y 
 t2x because x, y then lies outside D. 
Therefore

SECTION 15.3 DOUBLE INTEGRALS OVER GENERAL REGIONS .... 997 

because Fx, y  fx, y when t1x  y  t 2x. Thus, we have the following formula 
that enables us to evaluate the double integral as an iterated integral.

The integral on the right side of (3) is an iterated integral that is similar to the ones we 
considered in the preceding section, except that in the inner integral we regard x as being 
constant not only in fx, y but also in the limits of integration, t1x and t 2x. 

We also consider plane regions of type II, which can be expressed as 

4 
D  x, y c  y  d, h1y  x  h2y
 

where h1 and h2 are continuous. Two such regions are illustrated in Figure 7.

SOLUTION The parabolas intersect when 2x, that is, x, so x  	1. We 
note that the region D, sketched in Figure 8, is a type I region but not a type II region 
and we can write

NOTE  When we set up a double integral as in Example 1, it is essential to draw a 
diagram. Often it is helpful to draw a vertical arrow as in Figure 8. Then the limits of 
integration for the inner integral can be read from the diagram as follows: The arrow 
starts at the lower boundary , which gives the lower limit in the integral, and 
the arrow ends at the upper boundary , which gives the upper limit of integration. 
For a type II region the arrow is drawn horizontally from the left boundary to the right 
boundary. 
EXAMPLE 2 Find the volume of the solid that lies under the paraboloid and 
above the region in the -plane bounded by the line and the parabola . 
SOLUTION 1 From Figure 9 we see that is a type I region and 
Therefore, the volume under and above is 
SOLUTION 2 From Figure 10 we see that can also be written as a type II region: 
Therefore, another expression for is 
EXAMPLE 3 Evaluate where is the region bounded by the line and 
the parabola . 
SOLUTION The region is shown in Figure 12. Again is both type I and type II, but 
the description of as a type I region is more complicated because the lower boundary 
consists of two parts. Therefore, we prefer to express as a type II region:

SOLUTION In a question such as this, it’s wise to draw two diagrams: one of the threedimensional 
solid and another of the plane region D over which it lies. Figure 13 shows 
the tetrahedron T bounded by the coordinate planes x  0, z  0, the vertical plane 
x  2y, and the plane x  2y  z  2. Since the plane x  2y  z  2 intersects the 
xy-plane (whose equation is z  0) in the line x  2y  2, we see that T lies above the

(See Figure 14.) 

The plane x  2y  z  2 can be written as z  2  x  2y, so the required volume

SOLUTION If we try to evaluate the integral as it stands, we are faced with the task of first 

D 
y=1 
evaluating x siny2  dy. But it’s impossible to do so in finite terms since x siny2  dy is 
not an elementary function. (See the end of Section 7.5.) So we must change the order 
of integration. This is accomplished by first expressing the given iterated integral as a 

y=x double integral. Using (3) backward, we have 

y 1 y 1

We sketch this region D in Figure 15. Then from Figure 16 we see that an alternative

description of D is

Properties of Double Integrals 

We assume that all of the following integrals exist. The first three properties of double integrals 
over a region D follow immediately from Definition 2 and Properties 7, 8, and 9 in 
Section 15.1.

Property 9 can be used to evaluate double integrals over regions D that are neither type I 

nor type II but can be expressed as a union of regions of type I or type II. Figure 18 illus


trates this procedure. (See Exercises 49 and 50.) 

The next property of integrals says that if we integrate the constant function f x, y  1 
over a region D, we get the area of D:

height is 1 has volume AD  1  AD, but we know that we can also write its volume 
as xxD 1 dA. 

Finally, we can combine Properties 7, 8, and 10 to prove the following property. (See

means that the plane intersects the paraboloid in the circle x2  y2  1, so the solid lies

|||| 15.5 Applications of Double Integrals 

We have already seen one application of double integrals: computing volumes. Another 
geometric application is finding areas of surfaces and this will be done in the next section. 
In this section we explore physical applications such as computing mass, electric charge, 
center of mass, and moment of inertia. We will see that these physical ideas are also important 
when applied to probability density functions of two random variables. 

Density and Mass 

In Section 8.3 we were able to use single integrals to compute moments and the center of 

y 

mass of a thin plate or lamina with constant density. But now, equipped with the double 

x, y  lim 
x, yD 
(x, y) 

integral, we can consider a lamina with variable density. Suppose the lamina occupies a 

region D of the xy-plane and its density (in units of mass per unit area) at a point x, y in 

D 


is given by 

, where 

is a continuous function on . This means that

where 
m and 
A are the mass and area of a small rectangle that contains x, y and the

1010 .... CHAPTER 15 MULTIPLE INTEGRALS 

y 


(x* ij, y* 

ij) Rij To find the total mass m of the lamina we divide a rectangle R containing D into sub


x, y 

to be 0 outside D. If

rectangles of the same size (as in Figure 2) and consider

Rij 


we choose a point xij *, yij * in Rij, then the mass of the part of the lamina that occupies Rij 

is approximately 

xij *, yij * 
A

, where 
A is the area of Rij. If we add all such masses, we 

get an approximation to the total mass:

For example, if an electric charge is distributed over a region D and the charge density (in 

x, y 

at a point 

x, y 

in D, then the total charge

Thus, the total charge is 245 C. 

Moments and Centers of Mass 

In Section 8.3 we found the center of mass of a lamina with constant density; here we consider 
a lamina with variable density. Suppose the lamina occupies a region D and has den


sity function 

x, y

. Recall from Chapter 8 that we defined the moment of a particle about 

an axis as the product of its mass and its directed distance from the axis. We divide D into 

x* ij, y*ij  
A

, so we

small rectangles as in Figure 2. Then the mass of Rij is approximately 

can approximate the moment of Rij with respect to the x-axis by

x* ij, y*ij  
A	 yij 

If we now add these quantities and take the limit as the number of subrectangles becomes

significance is that the lamina behaves as if its entire mass is concentrated at its center 
of mass. Thus, the lamina balances horizontally when supported at its center of mass (see

The center of mass is at the point (83, 16). 

EXAMPLE 3 The density at any point on a semicircular lamina is proportional to the distance 
from the center of the circle. Find the center of mass of the lamina. 

SOLUTION Let’s place the lamina as the upper half of the circle x2  y2  a2 (see Figure 
6). Then the distance from a point x, y to the center of the circle (the origin) is 
s x2  y2. Therefore, the density function is 

x, y  Ks x2  y22p 
D ”0, ’3aa x where K is some constant. Both the density function and the shape of the lamina suggest 
that we convert to polar coordinates. Then s x2  y2  r and the region D is given by 

_a 0 

. Thus, the mass of the lamina is

Both the lamina and the density function are symmetric with respect to the y-axis, so the 
center of mass must lie on the y-axis, that is, x  0. The y-coordinate is given by

Moment of Inertia 

The moment of inertia (also called the second moment) of a particle of mass m about an 
axis is defined to be mr2, where r is the distance from the particle to the axis. We extend 

this concept to a lamina with density function 

x, y 

and occupying a region D by pro


ceeding as we did for ordinary moments. We divide D into small rectangles, approximate 
the moment of inertia of each subrectangle about the x-axis, and take the limit of the sum

as the number of subrectangles becomes large. The result is the moment of inertia of the 
lamina about the x-axis:

In Example 4 notice that the mass of the disk is

m  density  area  

so the moment of inertia of the disk about the origin (like a wheel about its axle) can be 
written as 

I0  12 ma2 

Thus, if we increase the mass or the radius of the disk, we thereby increase the moment of 


1014 .... CHAPTER 15 MULTIPLE INTEGRALS 

inertia. In general, the moment of inertia plays much the same role in rotational motion 
that mass plays in linear motion. The moment of inertia of a wheel is what makes it difficult 
to start or stop the rotation of the wheel, just as the mass of a car is what makes it difficult 
to start or stop the motion of the car. 

The radius of gyration of a lamina about an axis is the number R such that 

9 
mR2  I 

where m is the mass of the lamina and I is the moment of inertia about the given axis. 
Equation 9 says that if the mass of the lamina were concentrated at a distance R from the 
axis, then the moment of inertia of this “point mass” would be the same as the moment of 
inertia of the lamina. 

In particular, the radius of gyration y with respect to the x-axis and the radius of gyration 
x with respect to the y-axis are given by the equations 

10 
my2  Ix mx2  Iy 

Thus x, y is the point at which the mass of the lamina can be concentrated without changing 
the moments of inertia with respect to the coordinate axes. (Note the analogy with the 
center of mass.)

Probability 

In Section 8.5 we considered the probability density function f of a continuous random 
variable X. This means that f x  0 for all x, x f x dx  1, and the probability that X 

lies between a and b is found by integrating f from a to b: 

Pa  X  b  y bf x dx 

a 

Now we consider a pair of continuous random variables X and Y, such as the lifetimes 
of two components of a machine or the height and weight of an adult female chosen at random. 
The joint density function of X and Y is a function f of two variables such that the 
probability that X, Y lies in a region D is 

PX, Y  D  yyf x, y dA

FIGURE 7 

The probability that X lies between 
a and b and Y lies between c and d 
is the volume that lies above the 
rectangle D=[a, b]x[c, d] and 
below the graph of the joint 
density function. 

SECTION 15.5 APPLICATIONS OF DOUBLE INTEGRALS .... 1015 

In particular, if the region is a rectangle, the probability that X lies between a and b and Y 
lies between c and d is

As in Exercise 36 in Section 15.4, the double integral over 2 is an improper integral

SOLUTION We find the value of C by ensuring that the double integral of f is equal to 1. 
Because fx, y  0 outside the rectangle 0, 10	  0, 10	, we have

Suppose X is a random variable with probability density function f1x and Y is a ran

EXAMPLE 7 The manager of a movie theater determines that the average time moviegoers 
wait in line to buy a ticket for this week’s film is 10 minutes and the average time they 
wait to buy popcorn is 5 minutes. Assuming that the waiting times are independent, find 
the probability that a moviegoer waits a total of less than 20 minutes before taking his or 
her seat. 

SOLUTION Assuming that both the waiting time X for the ticket purchase and the waiting 
time Y in the refreshment line are modeled by exponential probability density functions, 
we can write the individual density functions as

This means that about 75% of the moviegoers wait less than 20 minutes before taking

Expected Values 

Recall from Section 8.5 that if X is a random variable with probability density function f, 
then its mean is 

 y  xf x dx 

Now if X and Y are random variables with joint density function f, we define the X-mean 
and Y-mean, also called the expected values of X and Y, to be

Notice how closely the expressions for 

of a lamina with density function 

in Equations 3 and 4. In fact, we can think of proba


bility as being like continuously distributed mass. We calculate probability the way we calculate 
mass—by integrating a density function. And because the total “probability mass” 
is 1, the expressions for x and y in (5) show that we can think of the expected values of X 

and Y, 

1 

and 

2

, as the coordinates of the “center of mass” of the probability distribution. 

In the next example we deal with normal distributions. As in Section 8.5, a single random 
variable is normally distributed if its probability density function is of the form

EXAMPLE 8 A factory produces (cylindrically shaped) roller bearings that are sold as 
having diameter 4.0 cm and length 6.0 cm. In fact, the diameters X are normally distributed 
with mean 4.0 cm and standard deviation 0.01 cm while the lengths Y are normally 
distributed with mean 6.0 cm and standard deviation 0.01 cm. Assuming that X and Y 
are independent, write the joint density function and graph it. Find the probability that 
a bearing randomly chosen from the production line has either length or diameter that 
differs from the mean by more than 0.02 cm.

Let S be a surface with equation z  fx, y, where f has continuous partial derivatives. 
For simplicity in deriving the surface area formula, we assume that fx, y 	0 and the 
domain Dof f is a rectangle. We divide D into small rectangles Rij with area A  x y. 
If xi, yj is the corner of Rij closest to the origin, let Pijxi, yj, fxi, yj be the point on S 
directly above it (see Figure 1). The tangent plane to S at Pij is an approximation to S near 
Pij. So the area Tij of the part of this tangent plane (a parallelogram) that lies directly 
above Rij is an approximation to the area Sij of the part of S that lies directly above Rij. 
Thus, the sum  Tij is an approximation to the total area of S, and this approximation 
appears to improve as the number of rectangles increases. Therefore, we define the surface 
area of S to be

we let a and b be the vectors that start at Pij and lie along the sides of the parallelogram 
with area Tij. (See Figure 2.) Then Tij  	 a b 	. Recall from Section 14.3 that fxxi, yj

We will verify in Section 16.6 that this formula is consistent with our previous formula 
for the area of a surface of revolution. If we use the alternative notation for partial derivatives, 
we can rewrite Formula 2 as follows: 
Notice the similarity between the surface area formula in Equation 3 and the arc length 
formula from Section 8.1: 
EXAMPLE 1 Find the surface area of the part of the surface that lies above 
the triangular region in the -plane with vertices , , and .

Just as we defined single integrals for functions of one variable and double integrals for 
functions of two variables, so we can define triple integrals for functions of three variables. 
Let’s first deal with the simplest case where f is defined on a rectangular box: 

1 
B  x, y, z	 a  x  b, c  y  d, r  z  s
 

The first step is to divide B into sub-boxes. We do this by dividing the interval a, b into 
l subintervals xi1, xi of equal width x, dividing c, d into m subintervals of width y, 
and dividing r, s into n subintervals of width z. The planes through the endpoints of 
these subintervals parallel to the coordinate planes divide the box B into lmn sub-boxes 

Bijk  xi1, xi  yj1, yj  zk1, zk 

y 

which are shown in Figure 1. Each sub-box has volume V  xy z. 
Then we form the triple Riemann sum

i1 j1 k1 

where the sample point * , yijk *  is in . By analogy with the definition of a double

xijk *, zijk Bijk 
integral (15.1.5), we define the triple integral as the limit of the triple Riemann sums in (2).

if this limit exists. 

Again, the triple integral always exists if f is continuous. We can choose the sample 
point to be any point in the sub-box, but if we choose it to be the point xi, yj, zk we get a 
simpler-looking expression for the triple integral:

The iterated integral on the right side of Fubini’s Theorem means that we integrate first 
with respect to x (keeping y and z fixed), then we integrate with respect to y (keeping z 
fixed), and finally we integrate with respect to z. There are five other possible orders in 
which we can integrate, all of which give the same value. For instance, if we integrate with 
respect to y, then , and then x, we have

Now we define the triple integral over a general bounded region E in threedimensional 
space (a solid) by much the same procedure that we used for double integrals 
(15.3.2). We enclose E in a box B of the type given by Equation 1. Then we define a 
function F so that it agrees with f on E but is 0 for points in B that are outside E. By 
definition, 

yyyfx, y, z dV  yyyFx, y, z dV 

EB 

This integral exists if f is continuous and the boundary of E is “reasonably smooth.” The 
triple integral has essentially the same properties as the double integral (Properties 6–9 in 
Section 15.3). 

We restrict our attention to continuous functions f and to certain simple types of regions. 
A solid region E is said to be of type 1 if it lies between the graphs of two continuous functions 
of x and y, that is,

E  x, y, z	x, y  D, u1x, y  z  u2x, y
 

where D is the projection of E onto the xy-plane as shown in Figure 2. Notice that the 
upper boundary of the solid E is the surface with equation z  u2x, y, while the lower 
boundary is the surface z  u1x, y.

The meaning of the inner integral on the right side of Equation 6 is that x and y are held 
fixed, and therefore u1x, y and u2x, y are regarded as constants, while fx, y, z is integrated 
with respect to z. 

In particular, if the projection D of E onto the xy-plane is a type I plane region (as in 
Figure 3), then 

E  x, y, z	 a  x  b, t1x  y  t2x, u1x, y  z  u2x, y

EXAMPLE 2 Evaluate xxxE z dV, where E is the solid tetrahedron bounded by the four 
planes x  0, y  0, z  0, and x  y  z  1. 

SOLUTION When we set up a triple integral it’s wise to draw two diagrams: one of 
the solid region E (see Figure 5) and one of its projection D on the xy-plane (see 
Figure 6). The lower boundary of the tetrahedron is the plane z  0 and the upper 
boundary is the plane x  y  z  1 (or z  1  x  y), so we use u1x, y  0 and 
u2x, y  1  x  y in Formula 7. Notice that the planes x  y  z  1 and z  0 
intersect in the line x  y  1 (or y  1  x) in the xy-plane. So the projection of E is 
the triangular region shown in Figure 6, and we have 

9 
E  x, y, z	 0  x  1, 0  y  1  x,0  z  1  x  y

A type 3 region 


Visual 15.7 illustrates how solid regions 
(including the one in Figure 9) project 
onto coordinate planes. 

A solid region E is of type 2 if it is of the form 

E  x, y, z	y, z  D, u1y, z  x  u2y, z
 

where, this time, D is the projection of E onto the yz-plane (see Figure 7). The back surface 
is x  u1y, z, the front surface is x  u2y, z, and we have

Finally, a type 3 region is of the form 

E  x, y, z	x, z  D, u1x, z  y  u2x, z
 

where D is the projection of E onto the xz-plane, y  u1x, z is the left surface, and 
y  u2x, z is the right surface (see Figure 8). For this type of region we have

u2x, z 

yyyf x, y, z dV  yyy f x, y, z dydA 
u1x, z

In each of Equations 10 and 11 there may be two possible expressions for the integral 
depending on whether D is a type I or type II plane region (and corresponding to Equations 
7 and 8). 

EXAMPLE 3 Evaluate xxxE s x2  z2 dV, where E is the region bounded by the paraboloid 
y  x2  z2 and the plane y  4. 

SOLUTION The solid E is shown in Figure 9. If we regard it as a type 1 region, then we 
need to consider its projection D1 onto the xy-plane, which is the parabolic region in 
Figure 10. (The trace of y  x2  z2 in the plane z  0 is the parabola y  x2.)

From y  x2  z2 we obtain z  sy  x2, so the lower boundary surface of E is

a type 1 region is 
E  {x, y, z	 2  x  2, x2  y  4, sy  x2  z  sy  x2}

Although this expression is correct, it is extremely difficult to evaluate. So let’s

instead consider E as a type 3 region. As such, its projection D3 onto the xz-plane is the

Then the left boundary of E is the paraboloid y  x2  z2 and the right boundary is

Applications of Triple Integrals 

Recall that if f x 	 0, then the single integral xab f x dx represents the area under the 
curve y  f x from a to b, and if f x, y 	 0, then the double integral xxDf x, y dA represents 
the volume under the surface z  f x, y and above D. The corresponding interpretation 
of a triple integral xxxEf x, y, z dV, where f x, y, z 	 0, is not very useful 
because it would be the “hypervolume” of a four-dimensional object and, of course, that 
is very difficult to visualize. (Remember that E is just the domain of the function f ; the 
graph of f lies in four-dimensional space.) Nonetheless, the triple integral xxxEf x, y, z dV 
can be interpreted in different ways in different physical situations, depending on the physical 
interpretations of x, y, z and f x, y, z. 

Let’s begin with the special case where f x, y, z  1 for all points in E. Then the triple 
integral does represent the volume of E: 

12 
VE  yyydV

For example, you can see this in the case of a type 1 region by putting f x, y, z  1 in 
Formula 6:

and from Section 15.3 we know this represents the volume that lies between the surfaces

EXAMPLE 4 Use a triple integral to find the volume of the tetrahedron T bounded by the

SOLUTION The tetrahedron T and its projection D on the xy-plane are shown in Figures 12 
and 13. The lower boundary of T is the plane z  0 and the upper boundary is the plane 
x  2y  z  2, that is, z  2  x  2y. Therefore, we have

SECTION 15.8 TRIPLE INTEGRALS IN CYLINDRICAL AND SPHERICAL COORDINATES .... 1033 

|||| 15.8 Triple Integrals in Cylindrical and Spherical Coordinates 

We saw in Section 15.4 that some double integrals are easier to evaluate using polar coordinates. 
In this section we see that some triple integrals are easier to evaluate using cylindrical 
or spherical coordinates. 

Cylindrical Coordinates 

P 


are 

r, 

	, z.


, where

Recall from Section 12.7 that the cylindrical coordinates of a point

z are shown in Figure 1. Suppose that E is a type 1 region whose projection D on 

the xy-plane is conveniently described in polar coordinates (see Figure 2). In particular, 
suppose that f is continuous and 

E  x, y, zx, y  D, u1x, y  z  u2x, y	 
where D is given in polar coordinates by

Formula 2 is the formula for triple integration in cylindrical coordinates. It says that 
we convert a triple integral from rectangular to cylindrical coordinates by writing 

x  r cos

y  r sin 

	, leaving 
z 


as it is, using the appropriate limits of integration for 

z, r

, and 

	, and replacing 
dV 

by 

rdz dr d	. (Figure 3 shows how to remember this.) It is 

Volume element in cylindrical worthwhile to use this formula when E is a solid region easily described in cylindrical 
coordinates: dV=r dz dr d¨ coordinates, and especially when the function f x, y, z involves the expression x2  y2.

Suppose that a solid ball (a marble), a hollow ball (a squash ball), a solid cylinder (a steel bar),

first? (Make a guess before proceeding.) 
To answer this question we consider a ball or cylinder with mass , radius , and moment of 
inertia (about the axis of rotation). If the vertical drop is , then the potential energy at the top 
is . Suppose the object reaches the bottom with velocity and angular velocity , so . 
The kinetic energy at the bottom consists of two parts: from translation (moving down the 
slope) and from rotation. If we assume that energy loss from rolling friction is negligible, 
then conservation of energy gives

|||| 15.9 Change of Variables in Multiple Integrals 

In one-dimensional calculus we often use a change of variable (a substitution) to simplify 
an integral. By reversing the roles of x and u, we can write the Substitution Rule (5.5.6) as 

bd

f x dx  y

f tutu du

where x  tu and a  tc, b  td. Another way of writing Formula 1 is as follows:

A change of variables can also be useful in double integrals. We have already seen one

example of this: conversion to polar coordinates. The new variables and

r

More generally, we consider a change of variables that is given by a transformation T 
from the uv-plane to the xy-plane: 
Tu, v  x, y 
where x and y are related to u and v by the equations 

3 
x  tu, v y  hu, v 

or, as we sometimes write, 
x  xu, v y  yu, v 

We usually assume that T is a C1 transformation, which means that t and h have continuous 
first-order partial derivatives. 

A transformation T is really just a function whose domain and range are both subsets 
of 2. If Tu1, v1  x1, y1, then the point x1, y1 is called the image of the point u1, v1. 
If no two points have the same image, T is called one-to-one. Figure 1 shows the effect of 
a transformation T on a region S in the uv-plane. T transforms S into a region R in the 
xy-plane called the image of S, consisting of the images of all points in S.

If T is a one-to-one transformation, then it has an inverse transformation T1 from the 
xy-plane to the uv-plane and it may be possible to solve Equations 3 for u and v in terms 
of x and y: 

u  Gx, y v  Hx, y 

EXAMPLE 1 A transformation is defined by the equations 

x  u2  v2 y  2uv 

Find the image of the square S  u, v 0  u  1, 0  v  1. 

SOLUTION The transformation maps the boundary of S into the boundary of the image. So 
we begin by finding the images of the sides of S. The first side, S1, is given by v  0 
0  u  1. (See Figure 2.) From the given equations we have x  u2, y  0, and so 
0  x  1. Thus, S1 is mapped into the line segment from 0, 0 to 1, 0 in the xy-plane. 
The second side, S2, is u  1 0  v  1 and, putting u  1 in the given equations, we 
get 

x  1  v2 y  2v 
Eliminating v, we obtain

x  1  0  x  1

which is part of a parabola. Similarly, S3 is given by v  1 0  u  1, whose image is 
the parabolic arc

5 
y

x   1 1  x  0 

4 

Finally, S4 is given by u  0 0  v  1 whose image is x  v2, y  0, that is, 
1  x  0. (Notice that as we move around the square in the counterclockwise direction, 
we also move around the parabolic region in the counterclockwise direction.) The 
image of S is the region R (shown in Figure 2) bounded by the x-axis and the parabolas 
given by Equations 4 and 5. 


Now let’s see how a change of variables affects a double integral. We start with a small 
rectangle S in the uv-plane whose lower left corner is the point u0, v0  and whose dimensions 
are u and v. (See Figure 3.)

is the position vector of the image of the point u, v. The equation of the lower side of S 
is v  v0, whose image curve is given by the vector function ru, v0. The tangent vector 
at x0, y0 to this image curve is

This means that we can approximate R by a parallelogram determined by the vectors 
u ru and v rv. (See Figure 5.) Therefore, we can approximate the area of R by the area 
of this parallelogram, which, from Section 12.4, is

The determinant that arises in this calculation is called the Jacobian of the transformation 
and is given a special notation.

mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi 
(1804–1851). Although the French mathematician 
Cauchy first used these special determinants 
involving partial derivatives, Jacobi developed 
them into a method for evaluating multiple 
integrals.

Change of Variables in a Double Integral Suppose that T is a C1 transformation 
whose Jacobian is nonzero and that maps a region S in the uv-plane onto a region 
R in the xy-plane. Suppose that f is continuous on R and that R and S are type I or 
type II plane regions. Suppose also that T is one-to-one, except perhaps on the 
boundary of S. Then

and y2  4  4x. 

SOLUTION The region R is pictured in Figure 2. In Example 1 we discovered that 
TS  R, where S is the square 0, 1  0, 1. Indeed, the reason for making the 
change of variables to evaluate the integral is that S is a much simpler region than R. 
First we need to compute the Jacobian:

NOTE  Example 2 was not a very difficult problem to solve because we were given a 
suitable change of variables. If we are not supplied with a transformation, then the first step 
is to think of an appropriate change of variables. If f x, y is difficult to integrate, then the 
form of f x, y may suggest a transformation. If the region of integration R is awkward, 
then the transformation should be chosen so that the corresponding region S in the uv-plane 
has a convenient description. 

xyxy dA

EXAMPLE 3 Evaluate the integral xxRe, where R is the trapezoidal region with 
vertices 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, and 0, 1. 

xyxy

SOLUTION Since it isn’t easy to integrate e, we make a change of variables suggested 
by the form of this function: 

10 
u  x  y v  x  y 

T1

These equations define a transformation from the xy-plane to the uv-plane. 
Theorem 9 talks about a transformation T from the uv-plane to the xy-plane. It is 
obtained by solving Equations 10 for x and y: 

11 
x  12 u  v y  12 u  v 

The Jacobian of T is 

x x

22 1 

11 2

u, v 

y y

u v 

To find the region S in the uv-plane corresponding to R, we note that the sides of R lie on 
the lines 
y  0 x  y  2 x  0 x  y  1 
and, from either Equations 10 or Equations 11, the image lines in the uv-plane are 

u  vv  2 u  vv  1 
Thus, the region S is the trapezoidal region with vertices 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, and 
1, 1 shown in Figure 8. Since 
S  u, v 1  v  2, v  u  v

SECTION 15.9 CHANGE OF VARIABLES IN MULTIPLE INTEGRALS .... 1047 

Triple Integrals 

There is a similar change of variables formula for triple integrals. Let T be a transformation 
that maps a region S in uvw-space onto a region R in xyz-space by means of the 
equations 

x  tu, v, w y  hu, v, w z  ku, v, w 

The Jacobian of T is the following 3  3 determinant: 

x x x

Under hypotheses similar to those in Theorem 9, we have the following formula for triple 
integrals:

x, y, z

The collection of wind velocity vectors 
(Chapter) 
at any given time during a tornado is an 
example of a vector field. 

Vector Calculus 



In this chapter we study the calculus of vector fields. (These 
are functions that assign vectors to points in space.) In particular 
we define line integrals (which can be used to find 
the work done by a force field in moving an object along 
a curve). Then we define surface integrals (which can be 
used to find the rate of fluid flow across a surface). The connections between these 
new types of integrals and the single, double, and triple integrals that we have 
already met are given by the higher-dimensional versions of the Fundamental Theorem 
of Calculus: Green’s Theorem, Stokes’ Theorem, and the Divergence Theorem. 
|||| 16.1 Vector Fields 
The vectors in Figure 1 are air velocity vectors that indicate the wind speed and direction 
at points 10 m above the surface elevation in the San Francisco Bay area. We see at a 
glance from the largest arrows in part (a) that the greatest wind speeds at that time occurred 
as the winds entered the bay across the Golden Gate Bridge. Part (b) shows the very different 
wind pattern at a later date. Associated with every point in the air we can imagine a 
wind velocity vector. This is an example of a velocity vector field.

(b) 4:00 P.M., June 30, 2002

Other examples of velocity vector fields are illustrated in Figure 2: ocean currents and 
flow past an airfoil. 
Another type of vector field, called a force field, associates a force vector with each 
point in a region. An example is the gravitational force field that we will look at in 
Example 4. 
In general, a vector field is a function whose domain is a set of points in (or ) and 
whose range is a set of vectors in (or ). 
Definition Let be a set in (a plane region). A vector field on is a function 
that assigns to each point in a two-dimensional vector . 
The best way to picture a vector field is to draw the arrow representing the vector 
starting at the point . Of course, it’s impossible to do this for all points , but we 
can gain a reasonable impression of by doing it for a few representative points in as 
in Figure 3. Since is a two-dimensional vector, we can write it in terms of its component 
functions and as follows: 
or, for short, 
Notice that and are scalar functions of two variables and are sometimes called scalar 
fields to distinguish them from vector fields. 
Definition Let be a subset of . A vector field on is a function that 
assigns to each point in a three-dimensional vector . 
A vector field on is pictured in Figure 4. We can express it in terms of its component 
functions , , and as 
As with the vector functions in Section 13.1, we can define continuity of vector fields 
and show that is continuous if and only if its component functions , , and are 
continuous.

SECTION 16.1 VECTOR FIELDS .... 1057 
We sometimes identify a point with its position vector and write 
instead of . Then becomes a function that assigns a vector to a 
vector . 
EXAMPLE 1 A vector field on is defined by 
Describe by sketching some of the vectors as in Figure 3. 
SOLUTION Since , we draw the vector starting at the point in 
Figure 5. Since , we draw the vector with starting point . 
Continuing in this way, we calculate several other representative values of in the 
table and draw the corresponding vectors to represent the vector field in Figure 5. 
It appears from Figure 5 that each arrow is tangent to a circle with center the origin. 
To confirm this, we take the dot product of the position vector with the 
vector : 
This shows that is perpendicular to the position vector and is therefore 
tangent to a circle with center the origin and radius . Notice also that 
so the magnitude of the vector is equal to the radius of the circle. 
Some computer algebra systems are capable of plotting vector fields in two or three 
dimensions. They give a better impression of the vector field than is possible by hand 
because the computer can plot a large number of representative vectors. Figure 6 shows a 
computer plot of the vector field in Example 1; Figures 7 and 8 show two other vector 
fields. Notice that the computer scales the lengths of the vectors so they are not too long 
and yet are proportional to their true lengths.

EXAMPLE 2 Sketch the vector field on given by . 
SOLUTION The sketch is shown in Figure 9. Notice that all vectors are vertical and point 
upward above the -plane or downward below it. The magnitude increases with the 
distance from the -plane. 
We were able to draw the vector field in Example 2 by hand because of its particularly 
simple formula. Most three-dimensional vector fields, however, are virtually impossible to 
sketch by hand and so we need to resort to a computer algebra system. Examples are 
shown in Figures 10, 11, and 12. Notice that the vector fields in Figures 10 and 11 have similar 
formulas, but all the vectors in Figure 11 point in the general direction of the negative 
y-axis because their y-components are all 2. If the vector field in Figure 12 represents a 
velocity field, then a particle would be swept upward and would spiral around the -axis in 
the clockwise direction as viewed from above. 
EXAMPLE 3 Imagine a fluid flowing steadily along a pipe and let be the 
velocity vector at a point . Then assigns a vector to each point in a 
certain domain (the interior of the pipe) and so is a vector field on called a 
velocity field. A possible velocity field is illustrated in Figure 13. The speed at any given 
point is indicated by the length of the arrow. 
Velocity fields also occur in other areas of physics. For instance, the vector field in 
Example 1 could be used as the velocity field describing the counterclockwise rotation 
of a wheel. We have seen other examples of velocity fields in Figures 1 and 2. 
EXAMPLE 4 Newton’s Law of Gravitation states that the magnitude of the gravitational 
force between two objects with masses and is 
where is the distance between the objects and is the gravitational constant. (This 
is an example of an inverse square law.) Let’s assume that the object with mass is 
located at the origin in . (For instance, could be the mass of the Earth and the origin 
would be at its center.) Let the position vector of the object with mass be .

Notice the similarity between Formulas 3 and 4. Both vector fields are examples of 
force fields.

grad f ) is defined by 

fx, y  fxx, y i  fyx, y j 

Therefore, .f is really a vector field on 2 and is called a gradient vector field. Likewise, 
if f is a scalar function of three variables, its gradient is a vector field on 3 given by

Figure 15 shows a contour map of f with the gradient vector field. Notice that the gradient 
vectors are perpendicular to the level curves, as we would expect from Section 14.6. 
Notice also that the gradient vectors are long where the level curves are close to each 
other and short where they are farther apart. That’s because the length of the gradient

_4 

vector is the value of the directional derivative of f and close level curves indicate a 
FIGURE 15 steep graph. 

A vector field F is called a conservative vector field if it is the gradient of some scalar 

function, that is, if there exists a function f such that F  .f. In this situation f is called

example, the gravitational field F in Example 4 is conservative because if we define

The flow lines (or streamlines) of a vector field are the paths

field. Thus, the vectors in a vector field are tangent to the flow 
lines.

In this section we define an integral that is similar to a single integral except that instead 
of integrating over an interval a, b, we integrate over a curve C. Such integrals are called 
line integrals, although “curve integrals” would be better terminology. They were invented 
in the early 19th century to solve problems involving fluid flow, forces, electricity, and 
magnetism. 

We start with a plane curve C given by the parametric equations 

1 
x  xt y  yt a  t  b 

or, equivalently, by the vector equation rt  xt i  yt j, and we assume that C is a 
smooth curve. [This means that r is continuous and rt  0. See Section 13.2.] If we 
divide the parameter interval a, b into n subintervals ti1, ti  of equal width and we let 
xi  xti  and yi  yti , then the corresponding points Pixi, yi  divide C into n subarcs 
with lengths s1, s2, ..., sn. (See Figure 1.) We choose any point Pi *xi *, yi * in the ith 
subarc. (This corresponds to a point t* i in ti1, ti.) Now if f is any function of two variables 
whose domain includes the curve C, we evaluate f at the point xi *, yi *, multiply by 
the length si of the subarc, and form the sum 

n 

 f xi *, yi * si 

i1 

which is similar to a Riemann sum. Then we take the limit of these sums and make the following 
definition by analogy with a single integral. 

2 
Definition If f is defined on a smooth curve C given by Equations 1, then the 
line integral of f along C is 
n

if this limit exists.

SECTION 16.2 LINE INTEGRALS .... 1063 

A similar type of argument can be used to show that if f is a continuous function, then the 
limit in Definition 2 always exists and the following formula can be used to evaluate the 
line integral:

The value of the line integral does not depend on the parametrization of the curve, provided 
that the curve is traversed exactly once as t increases from a to b.

C 
In the special case where C is the line segment that joins a, 0 to b, 0, using x as the 
parameter, we can write the parametric equations of C as follows: x  x, y  0, 
a  x  b. Formula 3 then becomes 

yf x, y ds  y bf x, 0 dx 

Ca 

and so the line integral reduces to an ordinary single integral in this case. 
Just as for an ordinary single integral, we can interpret the line integral of a positive 

function as an area. In fact, if f x, y  0, xCf x, y ds represents the area of one side of 
the “fence” or “curtain” in Figure 2, whose base is C and whose height above the point 

FIGURE 2 x, y is f x, y. 

EXAMPLE 1 Evaluate xC 2  x2y ds, where C is the upper half of the unit circle 
x2  y2  1. 

SOLUTION In order to use Formula 3 we first need parametric equations to represent C. 
Recall that the unit circle can be parametrized by means of the equations 

x  cos ty  sin t

and the upper half of the circle is described by the parameter interval 0  t 

Suppose now that C is a piecewise-smooth curve; that is, C is a union of a finite number 
of smooth curves C1, C2, ..., Cn, where, as illustrated in Figure 4, the initial point of 
Ci1 is the terminal point of Ci. Then we define the integral of f along C as the sum of the 
integrals of f along each of the smooth pieces of C :

It frequently happens that line integrals with respect to x and y occur together. When 
this happens, it’s customary to abbreviate by writing

CC C 

When we are setting up a line integral, sometimes the most difficult thing is to think of 
a parametric representation for a curve whose geometric description is given. In particular, 
we often need to parametrize a line segment, so it’s useful to remember that a vector representation 
of the line segment that starts at r0 and ends at r1 is given by

Notice that we got different answers in parts (a) and (b) of Example 4 even though the 
two curves had the same endpoints. Thus, in general, the value of a line integral depends 
not just on the endpoints of the curve but also on the path. (But see Section 16.3 for conditions 
under which the integral is independent of the path.)

SECTION 16.2 LINE INTEGRALS .... 1067 

Notice also that the answers in Example 4 depend on the direction, or orientation, of the 
curve. If C1 denotes the line segment from 0, 2 to 5, 3, you can verify, using the 
parametrization 

x  5ty  2  5t 0  t  1 

that yy2 dx  x dy  5

In general, a given parametrization x  xt, y  yt, a  t  b, determines an orientation 
of a curve C, with the positive direction corresponding to increasing values of the 
parameter t. (See Figure 8, where the initial point A corresponds to the parameter value a 
and the terminal point B corresponds to t  b.) 

If C denotes the curve consisting of the same points as C but with the opposite orientation 
(from initial point B to terminal point A in Figure 8), then we have 

_CA 
B yf x, y dx  yf x, y dx yf x, y dy  yf x, y dy 

CC CC 

But if we integrate with respect to arc length, the value of the line integral does not change 
when we reverse the orientation of the curve: 

FIGURE 8 

yf x, y ds  yf x, y ds 

CC 

This is because si is always positive, whereas xi and yi change sign when we reverse 
the orientation of C. 

Line Integrals in Space 

We now suppose that C is a smooth space curve given by the parametric equations 

x  xt y  yt z  zt a  t  b 

or by a vector equation rt  xt i  yt j  zt k. If f is a function of three variables 
that is continuous on some region containing C, then we define the line integral of f

Line Integrals of Vector Fields 

Recall from Section 6.4 that the work done by a variable force f x in moving a particle 
from a to b along the x-axis is W  xab f x dx. Then in Section 12.3 we found that the 
work done by a constant force F in moving an object from a point P to another point Q in

l

space is W  F  D, where D  PQ is the displacement vector. 

Now suppose that F  P i  Q j  R k is a continuous force field on 3, such as the 
gravitational field of Example 4 in Section 16.1 or the electric force field of Example 5 in 
Section 16.1. (A force field on 2 could be regarded as a special case where R  0 and P 
and Q depend only on x and y.) We wish to compute the work done by this force in moving 
a particle along a smooth curve C.

We divide C into subarcs Pi1Pi with lengths si by dividing the parameter interval

Figure 11 for the three-dimensional case.) Choose a point Pi *xi *, yi *, zi * on the th subarc 

i 
corresponding to the parameter value t* i . If si is small, then as the particle moves from 
Pi1 to Pi along the curve, it proceeds approximately in the direction of Tt*i , the unit tangent 
vector at Pi *. Thus, the work done by the force F in moving the particle from Pi1 to 
Pi is approximately 

Fxi *, yi *, zi *  si Tt*i   Fxi *, yi *, zi *  Tt*i  si

where Tx, y, z is the unit tangent vector at the point x, y, z on C. Intuitively, we see that 
these approximations ought to become better as n becomes larger. Therefore, we define the 
work W done by the force field F as the limit of the Riemann sums in (11), namely,

Equation 12 says that work is the line integral with respect to arc length of the tangential 
component of the force.

This integral is often abbreviated as xC F  dr and occurs in other areas of physics as well. 
Therefore, we make the following definition for the line integral of any continuous vector 
field.

Definition Let F be a continuous vector field defined on a smooth curve C 

given by a vector function rt, a  t  b. Then the line integral of F along C is 
yF  dr  y b Frt  r	t dt  yF  T ds 

Ca C 

When using Definition 13, remember that Frt is just an abbreviation for 

Fxt, yt, zt, so we evaluate Frt simply by putting x  xt, y  yt, and z  zt 

in the expression for Fx, y, z. Notice also that we can formally write dr  r	t dt.

Finally, we note the connection between line integrals of vector fields and line integrals

of scalar fields. Suppose the vector field F on 3 is given in component form by the equation 
F  P i  Q j  R k. We use Definition 13 to compute its line integral along C:

FIGURE 13

|||| 16.3 The Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals 

Recall from Section 5.3 that Part 2 of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus can be written 
as 

1 
y bFx dx  Fb  Fa 

a 

where F is continuous on a, b. We also called Equation 1 the Net Change Theorem: The 
integral of a rate of change is the net change. 

If we think of the gradient vector .f of a function f of two or three variables as a sort 
of derivative of f, then the following theorem can be regarded as a version of the Fundamental 
Theorem for line integrals. 

2 
Theorem Let C be a smooth curve given by the vector function rt, a  t  b. 
Let f be a differentiable function of two or three variables whose gradient vector 
.f is continuous on C. Then 
yf  dr  frb  fra 

C 

NOTE  Theorem 2 says that we can evaluate the line integral of a conservative vector 
field (the gradient vector field of the potential function f ) simply by knowing the value of 
f at the endpoints of C. In fact, Theorem 2 says that the line integral of .f is the net 
change in f. If f is a function of two variables and C is a plane curve with initial point 
Ax1, y1  and terminal point Bx2, y2 , as in Figure 1, then Theorem 2 becomes 

yf  dr  fx2, y2   fx1, y1  

C 

If f is a function of three variables and C is a space curve joining the point Ax1, y1, z1  
to the point Bx2, y2, z2 , then we have 

yf  dr  fx2, y2, z2   fx1, y1, z1 

Although we have proved Theorem 2 for smooth curves, it is also true for piecewisesmooth 
curves. This can be seen by subdividing C into a finite number of smooth curves 
and adding the resulting integrals.

Independence of Path 

Suppose C1 and C2 are two piecewise-smooth curves (which are called paths) that have the 
same initial point A and terminal point B. We know from Example 4 in Section 16.2 that, 
in general, xF  dr  x F  dr. But one implication of Theorem 2 is that 

C1 C2

yf  dr  yf  dr 

C1 C2 

whenever .f is continuous. In other words, the line integral of a conservative vector field 
depends only on the initial point and terminal point of a curve. 

In general, if F is a continuous vector field with domain D, we say that the line integral 
xF  dr is independent of path if xF  dr  xF  dr for any two paths C1 and C2 in

CC1 C2

D that have the same initial and terminal points. With this terminology we can say that line 
integrals of conservative vector fields are independent of path. 

A curve is called closed if its terminal point coincides with its initial point, that is, 
rb  ra. (See Figure 2.) If xC F  dr is independent of path in D and C is any closed 
path in D, we can choose any two points A and B on C and regard C as being composed 
of the path C1 from A to B followed by the path C2 from B to A. (See Figure 3.) Then 

yF  dr  yF  dr  yF  dr  yF  dr  yF  dr  0 

CC1 C2 C1 C2 

since C1 and C2 have the same initial and terminal points. 

Conversely, if it is true that xC F  dr  0 whenever C is a closed path in D, then we 
demonstrate independence of path as follows. Take any two paths C1 and C2 from A to B 
in D and define C to be the curve consisting of C1 followed by C2. Then 

0  yF  dr  yF  dr  yF  dr  yF  dr  yF  dr 

CC1 C2 C1 C2 

and so xF  dr  xF  dr. Thus, we have proved the following theorem. 

C1 C2 

3 
Theorem xC F  dr is independent of path in D if and only if xC F  dr  0 for 
every closed path C in D. 
Since we know that the line integral of any conservative vector field F is independent 
of path, it follows that xC F  dr  0 for any closed path. The physical interpretation is that 
the work done by a conservative force field (such as the gravitational or electric field in 
Section 16.1) as it moves an object around a closed path is 0. 

The following theorem says that the only vector fields that are independent of path are 
conservative. It is stated and proved for plane curves, but there is a similar version for 
space curves. We assume that D is open, which means that for every point P in D there is 
a disk with center P that lies entirely in D. (So D doesn’t contain any of its boundary 
points.) In addition, we assume that D is connected. This means that any two points in D 
can be joined by a path that lies in D. 

4 
Theorem Suppose F is a vector field that is continuous on an open connected 
region D. If xC F  dr is independent of path in D, then F is a conservative vector 
field on D; that is, there exists a function f such that .f  F.

The converse of Theorem 5 is true only for a special type of region. To explain this, we 
first need the concept of a simple curve, which is a curve that doesn’t intersect itself anywhere 
between its endpoints. [See Figure 6; ra  rb for a simple closed curve, but 
rt1   rt2  when a  t1  t2  b.] 

In Theorem 4 we needed an open connected region. For the next theorem we need a 
stronger condition. A simply-connected region in the plane is a connected region D such 


1078 .... CHAPTER 16 VECTOR CALCULUS 


that every simple closed curve in D encloses only points that are in D. Notice from Figure 
7 that, intuitively speaking, a simply-connected region contains no hole and can’t consist 
of two separate pieces. 


simply-connected region In terms of simply-connected regions we can now state a partial converse to Theorem 5 
that gives a convenient method for verifying that a vector field on 2 is conservative. The 
proof will be sketched in the next section as a consequence of Green’s Theorem.

F is not conservative. The calculation in

vectors near the curves C1 and C2 in Figure 9 
point in approximately the same direction as the

Notice that the constant of integration is a constant with respect to x, that is, a function 
of y, which we have called ty. Next we differentiate both sides of (9) with respect to y: 

10 
fyx, y  x2  ty 

Comparing (8) and (10), we see that 

ty  3y2 

Integrating with respect to y, we have 
ty  y3  K 
where K is a constant. Putting this in (9), we have 
fx, y  3x  x2 y  y3  K 
as the desired potential function.

A criterion for determining whether or not a vector field F on 3 is conservative is given 
in Section 16.5. Meanwhile, the next example shows that the technique for finding the 
potential function is much the same as for vector fields on 2.

Integrating (11) with respect to x, we get 
f x, y, z  xy2  ty, z 
where ty, z is a constant with respect to x. Then differentiating (14) with respect to y, 
we have 
fyx, y, z  2xy  tyy, z 
and comparison with (12) gives 
tyy, z  e3z 
Thus, ty, z  ye3z  hz and we rewrite (14) as 
f x, y, z  xy2  ye3z  hz 
Finally, differentiating with respect to z and comparing with (13), we obtain hz  0 
and, therefore, hz  K, a constant. The desired function is 
f x, y, z  xy2  ye3z  K 
It is easily verified that .f  F.

Conservation of Energy 

Let’s apply the ideas of this chapter to a continuous force field F that moves an object 
along a path C given by rt, a  t  b, where ra  A is the initial point and rb  B 
is the terminal point of C. According to Newton’s Second Law of Motion (see Section

equation

The quantity 21 m  vt2, that is, half the mass times the square of the speed, is called the

W  KB  KA 

which says that the work done by the force field along C is equal to the change in kinetic 
energy at the endpoints of C. 

Now let’s further assume that F is a conservative force field; that is, we can write 

F  .f . In physics, the potential energy of an object at the point x, y, z is defined as 

Px, y, z  f x, y, z, so we have F  .P. Then by Theorem 2 we have

the vector field is called conservative.

Green’s Theorem gives the relationship between a line integral around a simple closed 
curve C and a double integral over the plane region D bounded by C. (See Figure 1. We 
assume that D consists of all points inside C as well as all points on C.) In stating Green’s 
Theorem we use the convention that the positive orientation of a simple closed curve C 
refers to a single counterclockwise traversal of C. Thus, if C is given by the vector func-

DC tion rt, a  t  b, then the region D is always on the left as the point rt traverses C.

|||| Green’s Theorem is named after the 
self-taught English scientist George Green 
(1793–1841). He worked full-time in his father’s 
bakery from the age of nine and taught himself 
mathematics from library books. In 1828 he 
published privately An Essay on the Application 
of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of 
Electricity and Magnetism, but only 100 copies 
were printed and most of those went to his 
friends. This pamphlet contained a theorem 
that is equivalent to what we know as Green’s 
Theorem, but it didn’t become widely known 
at that time. Finally, at age 40, Green entered 
Cambridge University as an undergraduate 
but died four years after graduation. In 1846 
William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) located a copy 
of Green’s essay, realized its significance, and 
had it reprinted. Green was the first person to 
try to formulate a mathematical theory of electricity 
and magnetism. His work was the basis 
for the subsequent electromagnetic theories of 
Thomson, Stokes, Rayleigh, and Maxwell.

Green’s Theorem should be regarded as the counterpart of the Fundamental Theorem of 
Calculus for double integrals. Compare Equation 1 with the statement of the Fundamental 
Theorem of Calculus, Part 2, in the following equation: 

y bFx dx  Fb  Fa 

a 

In both cases there is an integral involving derivatives ( F, Q	x, and P	y) on the left 
side of the equation. And in both cases the right side involves the values of the original 
functions (F, Q, and P) only on the boundary of the domain. (In the one-dimensional case, 
the domain is an interval a, b whose boundary consists of just two points, a and b.) 

Green’s Theorem is not easy to prove in the generality stated in Theorem 1, but we can 
give a proof for the special case where the region is both of type I and of type II (see 
Section 15.3). Let’s call such regions simple regions. 

Proof of Green’s Theorem for the Case in Which D Is a Simple Region Notice that Green’s Theorem 
will be proved if we can show that

We prove Equation 2 by expressing D as a type I region: 

D  x, y a  x  b, t1x  y  t 2x 

where t1 and t 2 are continuous functions. This enables us to compute the double integral 
on the right side of Equation 2 as follows:

where the last step follows from the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. 

Now we compute the left side of Equation 2 by breaking up C as the union of the 
four curves C1, C2, C3, and C4 shown in Figure 3. On C1 we take x as the parameter and 
write the parametric equations as x  x, y  t1x, a  x  b. Thus 

yPx, y dx  y bPx, t1x dx 

C1 a 

Observe that C3 goes from right to left but C3 goes from left to right, so we can write 
the parametric equations of C3 as x  x, y  t 2x, a  x  b. Therefore

SOLUTION Although the given line integral could be evaluated as usual by the methods of 
Section 16.2, that would involve setting up three separate integrals along the three sides 
of the triangle, so let’s use Green’s Theorem instead. Notice that the region D enclosed 
by C is simple and C has positive orientation (see Figure 4). If we let Px, y  x4 and

In Examples 1 and 2 we found that the double integral was easier to evaluate than the 
line integral. (Try setting up the line integral in Example 2 and you’ll soon be convinced!) 
But sometimes it’s easier to evaluate the line integral, and Green’s Theorem is used in the 
reverse direction. For instance, if it is known that Px, y  Qx, y  0 on the curve C, 
then Green’s Theorem gives

no matter what values P and Q assume in the region D. 

Another application of the reverse direction of Green’s Theorem is in computing areas. 
Since the area of D is xxD 1 dA, we wish to choose P and Q so that

Then Green’s Theorem gives the following formulas for the area of D:

Green’s Theorem can be extended to apply to regions with holes, that is, regions that 
are not simply-connected. Observe that the boundary C of the region D in Figure 8 consists 
of two simple closed curves C1 and C2. We assume that these boundary curves are 
oriented so that the region D is always on the left as the curve C is traversed. Thus, the 
positive direction is counterclockwise for the outer curve C1 but clockwise for the inner

A curve that is not simple crosses itself at one or more points and can be broken up into 
a number of simple curves. We have shown that the line integrals of F around these 
simple curves are all 0 and, adding these integrals, we see that xC F  dr  0 for any 
closed curve C. Therefore, xC F  dr is independent of path in D by Theorem 16.3.3. It 
follows that F is a conservative vector field.

|||| 16.5 Curl and Divergence 

In this section we define two operations that can be performed on vector fields and that 
play a basic role in the applications of vector calculus to fluid flow and electricity and magnetism. 
Each operation resembles differentiation, but one produces a vector field whereas 
the other produces a scalar field. 

Curl 

If F  P i  Q j  R k is a vector field on 3 and the partial derivatives of P, Q, and R 
all exist, then the curl of F is the vector field on 3 defined by

As an aid to our memory, let’s rewrite Equation 1 using operator notation. We introduce 
the vector differential operator . (“del”) as 

.  i  j  k 

x y z 
It has meaning when it operates on a scalar function to produce the gradient of f :

If we think of . as a vector with components 	x, 	y, and 	z, we can also consider 
the formal cross product of . with the vector field F as follows:

Since a conservative vector field is one for which , Theorem 3 can be rephrased 
as follows: 
If is conservative, then .curl F  0F 
F  .f 
This gives us a way of verifying that a vector field is not conservative. 


1092 .... CHAPTER 16 VECTOR CALCULUS 

EXAMPLE 2 Show that the vector field Fx, y, z  xz i xyz j y2 k is not 
conservative. 

SOLUTION In Example 1 we showed that 

curl F  y2 x i x j yz k 

This shows that curl F  0 and so, by Theorem 3, F is not conservative. 


The converse of Theorem 3 is not true in general, but the following theorem says the 
converse is true if F is defined everywhere. (More generally it is true if the domain is 
simply-connected, that is, “has no hole.”) Theorem 4 is the three-dimensional version 
of Theorem 16.3.6. Its proof requires Stokes’ Theorem and is sketched at the end of 
Section 16.8.

Since curl F  0 and the domain of F is 3, F is a conservative vector field by 
Theorem 4. 

(b) The technique for finding f was given in Section 16.3. We have

Integrating (5) with respect to x, we obtain 
fx, y, z  xy2z3 ty, z 
Differentiating (8) with respect to y, we get fyx, y, z  2xyz3 tyy, z, so comparison 
with (6) gives tyy, z  0. Thus, ty, z  hz and 
fzx, y, z  3xy2z2 hz

Then (7) gives hz  0. Therefore 

f x, y, z  xy2z3  K 

(x, y, z) 
The reason for the name curl is that the curl vector is associated with rotations. One 
connection is explained in Exercise 35. Another occurs when F represents the velocity 

curl F(x, y, z) 

field in fluid flow (see Example 3 in Section 16.1). Particles near (x, y, z) in the fluid tend 
to rotate about the axis that points in the direction of curl Fx, y, z and the length of this 
curl vector is a measure of how quickly the particles move around the axis (see Figure 1). 
If curl F  0 at a point P, then the fluid is free from rotations at P and F is called irrotational 
at P. In other words, there is no whirlpool or eddy at P. If curl F  0, then a 
tiny paddle wheel moves with the fluid but doesn’t rotate about its axis. If curl F  0, the 

FIGURE 1 

paddle wheel rotates about its axis. We give a more detailed explanation in Section 16.8 as 
a consequence of Stokes’ Theorem. 

Divergence 

If F  P i  Q j  R k is a vector field on 3 and P	x, Q	y, and R	z exist, then 
the divergence of F is the function of three variables defined by 

9 
P Q R 

div F   

x y z 

Observe that curl F is a vector field but div F is a scalar field. In terms of the gradient operator 
  	x i  	y j  	z k, the divergence of F can be written symbolically 
as the dot product of  and F: 

10 
div F    F 

EXAMPLE 4 If Fx, y, z  xz i  xyz j  y2 k, find div F. 
SOLUTION By the definition of divergence (Equation 9 or 10) we have 


div F    F  xz  xyz  y2  

x y z 
 z  xz

If F is a vector field on 3, then curl F is also a vector field on 3. As such, we can 
compute its divergence. The next theorem shows that the result is 0. 

Theorem If is a vector field on and , , and have 
continuous second-order partial derivatives, then 
div curl F  0

will be explained at the end of Section 16.9 as a 
consequence of the Divergence Theorem.

because the terms cancel in pairs by Clairaut’s Theorem. 


2 k

EXAMPLE 5 Show that the vector field Fx, y, z  xz i xyz j ycan’t be written as 
the curl of another vector field, that is, F  curl G. 

SOLUTION In Example 4 we showed that 

div F  z xz 

and therefore div F  0. If it were true that F  curl G, then Theorem 11 would give 

div F  div curl G  0 

which contradicts div F  0. Therefore, F is not the curl of another vector field. 


Again, the reason for the name divergence can be understood in the context of fluid 
flow. If Fx, y, z is the velocity of a fluid (or gas), then div Fx, y, z represents the net rate 
of change (with respect to time) of the mass of fluid (or gas) flowing from the point x, y, z 
per unit volume. In other words, div Fx, y, z measures the tendency of the fluid to diverge 
from the point x, y, z. If div F  0, then F is said to be incompressible. 

Another differential operator occurs when we compute the divergence of a gradient vector 
field f . If f is a function of three variables, we have 

2 f 2 f 2 f 

divf    f    

x2 y2 z2 

and this expression occurs so often that we abbreviate it as 2 f . The operator 

2    

is called the Laplace operator because of its relation to Laplace’s equation 

2 f 2 f 2 f 
2 f  2  2  2  0 

xyz

We can also apply the Laplace operator 2 to a vector field 

F  P i Q j R k 

in terms of its components: 

2 F  2P i 2Q j 2R k 


SECTION 16.5 CURL AND DIVERGENCE .... 1095 

Vector Forms of Green’s Theorem 

The curl and divergence operators allow us to rewrite Green’s Theorem in versions that 
will be useful in our later work. We suppose that the plane region D, its boundary curve 
C, and the functions P and Q satisfy the hypotheses of Green’s Theorem. Then we consider 
the vector field F  P i  Q j. Its line integral is

Equation 12 expresses the line integral of the tangential component of F along C as the 

double integral of the vertical component of curl F over the region D enclosed by C. We 

now derive a similar formula involving the normal component of F. 

If C is given by the vector equation

|||| 16.6 Parametric Surfaces and Their Areas 

In Section 8.2 we found the area of a surface of revolution and in Section 15.6 we found 
the area of a surface with the equation z  f x, y. Here we discuss more general surfaces, 
called parametric surfaces, and compute their areas. 

Parametric Surfaces 

In much the same way that we describe a space curve by a vector function rt of a single 
parameter t, we can describe a surface by a vector function ru, v of two parameters u and 

v. We suppose that 
1 
ru, v  xu, v i  yu, v j  zu, v k 
is a vector-valued function defined on a region D in the uv z

-plane. So x, y, and , the component 
functions of r, are functions of the two variables u and v with domain D. The set 
of all points x, y, z in 3 such that 

2 
x  xu, v y  yu, v z  zu, v 

and u, v varies throughout D, is called a parametric surface S and Equations 2 are called 
parametric equations of S. Each choice of u and v gives a point on S; by making all 
choices, we get all of S. In other words, the surface S is traced out by the tip of the position 
vector ru, v as u, v moves throughout the region D. (See Figure 1.) 

EXAMPLE 1 Identify and sketch the surface with vector equation 
ru, v  2 cos u i  v j  2 sin u k 
SOLUTION The parametric equations for this surface are 
x  2 cos uy  v z  2 sin u 
So for any point x, y, z on the surface, we have 
x2  z2  4 cos2u  4 sin2u  4 
This means that vertical cross-sections parallel to the xz-plane (that is, with y constant) 
are all circles with radius 4. Since y  v and no restriction is placed on v, the surface is a 
FIGURE 2 circular cylinder with radius 2 whose axis is the y-axis (see Figure 2).

SECTION 16.6 PARAMETRIC SURFACES AND THEIR AREAS .... 1099 
In Example 1 we placed no restrictions on the parameters u and and so we obtained 
the entire cylinder. If, for instance, we restrict u and by writing the parameter domain as 
then and we get the quarter-cylinder with length 3 illustrated in 
Figure 3. 
If a parametric surface S is given by a vector function , then there are two useful 
families of curves that lie on S, one family with u constant and the other with constant. 
These families correspond to vertical and horizontal lines in the -plane. If we keep 
constant by putting becomes a vector function of the single parameter 
and defines a curve lying on . (See Figure 4.) 
Similarly, if we keep constant by putting given by 
that lies on . We call these curves grid curves. (In Example 1, for instance, the grid 
curves obtained by letting u be constant are horizontal lines whereas the grid curves with 
constant are circles.) In fact, when a computer graphs a parametric surface, it usually 
depicts the surface by plotting these grid curves, as we see in the following example. 
EXAMPLE 2 Use a computer algebra system to graph the surface 
Which grid curves have u constant? Which have constant? 
SOLUTION We graph the portion of the surface with parameter domain 
in Figure 5. It has the appearance of a spiral tube. To identify the grid 
curves, we write the corresponding parametric equations: 
If is constant, then and are constant, so the parametric equations resemble 
those of the helix in Example 4 in Section 13.1. So the grid curves with constant are 
the spiral curves in Figure 5. We deduce that the grid curves with u constant must be the 
curves that look like circles in the figure. Further evidence for this assertion is that if u 
is kept constant, , then the equation shows that the -values vary 
from to . 
In Examples 1 and 2 we were given a vector equation and asked to graph the corresponding 
parametric surface. In the following examples, however, we are given the more 
challenging problem of finding a vector function to represent a given surface. In the rest of 
this chapter we will often need to do exactly that.

EXAMPLE 3 Find a vector function that represents the plane that passes through the 
point with position vector and that contains two nonparallel vectors a and b. 
SOLUTION If P is any point in the plane, we can get from to by moving a certain 
distance in the direction of and another distance in the direction of . So there are 
scalars u and such that A . (Figure 6 illustrates how this works, by 
means of the Parallelogram Law, for the case where and are positive. See also 
Exercise 38 in Section 12.2.) If r is the position vector of P, then 
A A 
So the vector equation of the plane can be written as 
where u and are real numbers. 
If we write , , , and , 
then we can write the parametric equations of the plane through the point as 
follows: 
EXAMPLE 4 Find a parametric representation of the sphere 
SOLUTION The sphere has a simple representation in spherical coordinates, so let’s 
choose the angles and in spherical coordinates as the parameters (see Section 12.7). 
Then, putting in the equations for conversion from spherical to rectangular coordinates 
(Equations 12.7.3), we obtain 
as the parametric equations of the sphere. The corresponding vector equation is 
We have and , so the parameter domain is the rectangle 
. The grid curves with constant are the circles of constant latitude 
(including the equator). The grid curves with constant are the meridians (semicircles), 
which connect the north and south poles.

trying to graph the sphere 
by solving the equation for and graphing the 
top and bottom hemispheres separately. Part of 
the sphere appears to be missing because of the 
rectangular grid system used by the computer.

EXAMPLE 5 Find a parametric representation for the cylinder 
xx2  y2  40  z  1 
SOLUTION The cylinder has a simple representation r  2 in cylindrical coordinates, so 

we choose as parameters

EXAMPLE 6 Find a vector function that represents the elliptic paraboloid .z  x2  2y2 
SOLUTION If we regard and as parameters, then the parametric equations are simply yx 
z  x2  2y2y  yx  x 
and the vector equation is 
rx, y  x i  y j  x2  2y2  k 
In Module 16.6 you can investigate 
several families of parametric surfaces. 
In general, a surface given as the graph of a function of and , that is, with an equation 
of the form , can always be regarded as a parametric surface by taking 
and as parameters and writing the parametric equations asy

z  f x, yy  yx  x 
Parametric representations (also called parametrizations) of surfaces are not unique. The 
next example shows two ways to parametrize a cone. 
EXAMPLE 7 Find a parametric representation for the surface , that is, the 
top half of the cone .z2  4x2  4y2 
z  2sx2  y2 
SOLUTION 1 One possible representation is obtained by choosing x and y as parameters: 
z  2sx2  y2y  yx  x 
So the vector equation is 
rx, y  x i  y j  2sx2  y2 k 
|||| For some purposes the parametric representations 
in Solutions 1 and 2 are equally good, 
but Solution 2 might be preferable in certain 
situations. If we are interested only in the part 
of the cone that lies below the plane , 
for instance, all we have to do in Solution 2 is 
z  1 
SOLUTION 2 Another representation results from choosing as parameters the polar coordinates 
r and . A point , , and 
 x, y, z

Surfaces of Revolution 

Surfaces of revolution can be represented parametrically and thus graphed using a computer. 
For instance, let’s consider the surface S obtained by rotating the curve y  f x, 

a  x  b

, about the -axis, where f x  0. Let 

be the angle of rotation as shown in

Therefore, we take and as parameters and regard Equations 3 as parametric equations 
of . The parameter domain is given by , . 
EXAMPLE 8 Find parametric equations for the surface generated by rotating the curve 
, , about the -axis. Use these equations to graph the surface of 
revolution. 
SOLUTION From Equations 3, the parametric equations are 
and the parameter domain is , . Using a computer to plot these 
equations and rotate the image, we obtain the graph in Figure 10. 
We can adapt Equations 3 to represent a surface obtained through revolution about the 
- or -axis. (See Exercise 28.) 
Tangent Planes 
We now find the tangent plane to a parametric surface traced out by a vector function 
at a point with position vector . If we keep constant by putting , then 
becomes a vector function of the single parameter and defines a grid curve 
lying on . (See Figure 11.) The tangent vector to at is obtained by taking the partial 
derivative of with respect to : 
Similarly, if we keep constant by putting , we get a grid curve given by 
that lies on , and its tangent vector at is

If is not , then the surface is called smooth (it has no “corners”). For a smooth 
surface, the tangent plane is the plane that contains the tangent vectors and , and the 
vector is a normal vector to the tangent plane. 
EXAMPLE 9 Find the tangent plane to the surface with parametric equations , , 
at the point . 
SOLUTION We first compute the tangent vectors: 
Thus, a normal vector to the tangent plane is 
Notice that the point corresponds to the parameter values and , so 
the normal vector there is 
Therefore, an equation of the tangent plane at is

Surface Area 
Now we define the surface area of a general parametric surface given by Equation 1. For 
simplicity we start by considering a surface whose parameter domain is a rectangle, and 
we divide it into subrectangles . Let’s choose to be the lower left corner of . 
(See Figure 13.) The part of the surface that corresponds to is called a patch and 
has the point with position vector as one of its corners. Let 
be the tangent vectors at as given by Equations 5 and 4.

The question remains whether our definition of surface area (6) is consistent with the 
surface area formula from single-variable calculus (8.2.4). 

We consider the surface S obtained by rotating the curve y  f x, a  x  b, about 
the x-axis, where f x  0 and f  is continuous. From Equations 3 we know that parametric

The relationship between surface integrals and surface area is much the same as the relationship 
between line integrals and arc length. Suppose f is a function of three variables 
whose domain includes a surface S. We divide S into patches Sij with area 
Sij. We evaluate 
f at a point Pij * in each patch, multiply by the area 
Sij, and form the sum 

mn

Notice the analogy with the definition of a line integral (16.2.2) and also the analogy with 
the definition of a double integral (15.1.5). 

To evaluate the surface integral in Equation 1 we approximate the patch area 
Sij by the 
area 
Tij of an approximating parallelogram in the tangent plane, and the limit becomes a 
double integral. We now explain the details for two types of surfaces, graphs and parametric 
surfaces. 

Graphs If the surface S is a graph of a function of two variables, then it has an equation 
of the form z  t x, y, x, y  D, and is illustrated in Figure 1. We first assume that 
the parameter domain D is a rectangle and we divide it into smaller rectangles Rij of equal 
size. The patch Sij lies directly above the rectangle Rij and the point Pij * in Sij is of the 
form xi *, yj *, t xi *, yj *. As with surface area in Section 15.6, we use the approximation

We first assume that the parameter domain D is a rectangle and we divide it into subrectangles

Formula 3 allows us to compute a surface integral by converting it into a double integral

Oriented Surfaces 

FIGURE 5

In order to define surface integrals of vector fields, we need to rule out nonorientable surfaces 
such as the Möbius strip shown in Figure 5. [It is named after the German geometer 
August Möbius (1790–1868).] You can construct one for yourself by taking a long rectangular 
strip of paper, giving it a half-twist, and taping the short edges together as in Figure 
6. If an ant were to crawl along the Möbius strip starting at a point P, it would end 
up on the “other side” of the strip (that is, with its upper side pointing in the opposite 
direction). Then, if the ant continued to crawl in the same direction, it would end up back

The two orientations of 
an orientable surface 

at the same point P without ever having crossed an edge. (If you have constructed a 
Möbius strip, try drawing a pencil line down the middle.) Therefore, a Möbius strip really 
has only one side. You can graph the Möbius strip using the parametric equations in Exercise 
30 in Section 16.6. 

From now on we consider only orientable (two-sided) surfaces. We start with a surface 
S that has a tangent plane at every point x, y, z on S (except at any boundary points). 

There are two unit normal vectors and at . (See Figure 7.) If it is pos-
sible to choose a unit normal vector at every such point so that varies con-
tinuously over , then is called an oriented surface and the given choice of provides 
with an orientation. There are two possible orientations for any orientable surface (see 
Figure 8). 
For a surface given as the graph of , we use Equation 16.6.7 and see that 
the induced orientation is given by the unit normal vector

Since the k-component is positive, this gives the upward orientation of the surface.

For a closed surface, that is, a surface that is the boundary of a solid region E, the 
convention is that the positive orientation is the one for which the normal vectors point 
outward from E, and inward-pointing normals give the negative orientation (see Figures 9 
and 10).

and velocity field 

vx, y, z 

flowing through S. (Think of S as an imagi


nary surface that doesn’t impede the fluid flow, like a fishing net across a stream.) Then the 

rate of flow (mass per unit time) per unit area is 

	v

. If we divide S into small patches Sij

, 


as in Figure 11 (compare with Figures 1 and 3), then Sij is nearly planar and so we can 
approximate the mass of fluid crossing Sij in the direction of the normal n per unit time by 

the quantity

A surface integral of this form occurs frequently in physics, even when F is not

unit normal vector n, then the surface integral of F over S is 

yyF  dS  yyF  n dS

This integral is also called the flux of F across S. 

In words, Definition 7 says that the surface integral of a vector field over S is equal to 
the surface integral of its normal component over S (as previously defined). 

Graphs In the case of a surface S given by a graph z  t x, y, we can find n by 
noting that S is also the level surface fx, y, z  z  t x, y  0. We know that the gradient

If, for instance, the vector field in Example 5 is a velocity field describing the flow of a 


fluid with density 1, then the answer,

, represents the rate of flow through the unit 

sphere in units of mass per unit time. 

Although we motivated the surface integral of a vector field using the example of fluid 
flow, this concept also arises in other physical situations. For instance, if E is an electric 
field (see Example 5 in Section 16.1), then the surface integral 

yyE  dS 

S 

is called the electric flux of E through the surface S. One of the important laws of electrostatics 
is Gauss’s Law, which says that the net charge enclosed by a closed surface S is 

10 
Q  0 yyE  dS 

S 

where 0 is a constant (called the permittivity of free space) that depends on the units used. 
(In the SI system, 0  8.8542  1012 C2Nm2.) Therefore, if the vector field F in 
Example 5 represents an electric field, we can conclude that the charge enclosed by S is 

Q  4

Another application of surface integrals occurs in the study of heat flow. Suppose the 
temperature at a point x, y, z in a body is ux, y, z. Then the heat flow is defined as the 
vector field 

F  K .u 

where K is an experimentally determined constant called the conductivity of the substance. 
The rate of heat flow across the surface S in the body is then given by the surface 
integral

EXAMPLE 6 The temperature u in a metal ball is proportional to the square of the distance 
from the center of the ball. Find the rate of heat flow across a sphere S of radius a with

SECTION 16.8 STOKES’ THEOREM .... 1121 

|||| 16.8 Stokes’ Theorem 
Stokes’ Theorem can be regarded as a higher-dimensional version of Green’s Theorem. 
Whereas Green’s Theorem relates a double integral over a plane region to a line integral 
around its plane boundary curve, Stokes’ Theorem relates a surface integral over a surface 
to a line integral around the boundary curve of (which is a space curve). Figure 1 shows 
an oriented surface with unit normal vector . The orientation of induces the positive 
orientation of the boundary curve C shown in the figure. This means that if you walk in 
the positive direction around with your head pointing in the direction of , then the surface 
will always be on your left.

FIGURE 1 
|||| Stokes’ Theorem is named after the Irish 
mathematical physicist Sir George Stokes 
(1819–1903). Stokes was a professor at Cambridge 
University (in fact he held the same 
position as Newton, Lucasian Professor of 
Mathematics) and was especially noted for his 
studies of fluid flow and light. What we call 
Stokes’ Theorem was actually discovered by 
the Scottish physicist Sir William Thomson 
(1824–1907, known as Lord Kelvin). Stokes 
learned of this theorem in a letter from Thomson 
in 1850 and asked students to prove it on an 
examination at Cambridge University in 1854. 
We don’t know if any of those students was 
able to do so. 

Stokes’ Theorem Let S be an oriented piecewise-smooth surface that is bounded 
by a simple, closed, piecewise-smooth boundary curve C with positive orientation. 
Let F be a vector field whose components have continuous partial derivatives on an 
open region in that contains S. Then

Since

Stokes’ Theorem says that the line integral around the boundary curve of S of the tangential 
component of F is equal to the surface integral of the normal component of the curl 
of F. 

The positively oriented boundary curve of the oriented surface S is often written as 

S, so Stokes’ Theorem can be expressed as 
1 
yy curl F  dS  yF  dr 

S 

S

There is an analogy among Stokes’ Theorem, Green’s Theorem, and the Fundamental 
Theorem of Calculus. As before, there is an integral involving derivatives on the left side 
of Equation 1 (recall that curl F is a sort of derivative of F) and the right side involves the 
values of F only on the boundary of .

S 

In fact, in the special case where the surface S is flat and lies in the xy-plane with 
upward orientation, the unit normal is k, the surface integral becomes a double integral, 
and Stokes’ Theorem becomes 

yF  dr  yy curl F  dS  yycurl F  k dA 

C 

SS 

This is precisely the vector form of Green’s Theorem given in Equation 16.5.12. Thus, we 
see that Green’s Theorem is really a special case of Stokes’ Theorem. 

Although Stokes’ Theorem is too difficult for us to prove in its full generality, we can 
give a proof when S is a graph and F, S, and C are well behaved.

Proof of a Special Case of Stokes’ Theorem We assume that the equation of S is z  tx, y, 
x, y  D, where t has continuous second-order partial derivatives and D is a simple 
plane region whose boundary curve C1 corresponds to C. If the orientation of S is 
upward, then the positive orientation of C corresponds to the positive orientation of C1. 
(See Figure 2.) We are given that F  P i  Q j  R k, where the partial derivatives of 
P, Q, and R are continuous. 

Since S is a graph of a function, we can apply Formula 16.7.8 with F replaced by 
curl F. The result is

where the partial derivatives of P, Q, and R are evaluated at x, y, tx, y. If 

x  xt y  yt a  t  b 

is a parametric representation of C1, then a parametric representation of C is 

x  xt y  yt z  txt, yt a  t  b 

This allows us, with the aid of the Chain Rule, to evaluate the line integral as follows:

where we have used Green’s Theorem in the last step. Then, using the Chain Rule again 
and remembering that P, Q, and R are functions of x, y, and z and that z is itself a function 
of x and y, we get 

Q z R z R z z 2z

1124 .... CHAPTER 16 VECTOR CALCULUS 

Note that in Example 2 we computed a surface integral simply by knowing the values 

of F on the boundary curve C. This means that if we have another oriented surface with the 

same boundary curve C, then we get exactly the same value for the surface integral! 

In general, if S1 and S2 are oriented surfaces with the same oriented boundary curve C 
and both satisfy the hypotheses of Stokes’ Theorem, then

This fact is useful when it is difficult to integrate over one surface but easy to integrate over 
the other. 
We now use Stokes’ Theorem to throw some light on the meaning of the curl vector. 
Suppose that C is an oriented closed curve and v represents the velocity field in fluid flow. 
T Consider the line integral 


yv  dr  yv  T ds 

v CC 

(a) jC v  dr>0, positive circulation and recall that v  T is the component of v in the direction of the unit tangent vector T. 
This means that the closer the direction of v is to the direction of T, the larger the value of 
v  T. Thus, xC v  dr is a measure of the tendency of the fluid to move around C and is 
called the circulation of v around C. (See Figure 5.) 
Now let P0x0, y0, z0  be a point in the fluid and let Sa be a small disk with radius a and 
center P0. Then (curl FPcurl FP0 for all points P on Sa because curl F is continuous. 
Thus, by Stokes’ Theorem, we get the following approximation to the circulation 
around the boundary circle Ca:

Equation 4 gives the relationship between the curl and the circulation. It shows that 
curl v  n is a measure of the rotating effect of the fluid about the axis n. The curling effect 
is greatest about the axis parallel to curl v. 

Finally, we mention that Stokes’ Theorem can be used to prove Theorem 16.5.4 (which 
states that if curl F  0 on all of 3, then F is conservative). From our previous work 
(Theorems 16.3.3 and 16.3.4), we know that F is conservative if xC F  dr  0 for every 
closed path C. Given C, suppose we can find an orientable surface S whose boundary is 

C. (This can be done, but the proof requires advanced techniques.) Then Stokes’ Theorem

gives

A curve that is not simple can be broken into a number of simple curves, and the integrals 
around these simple curves are all 0. Adding these integrals, we obtain xC F  dr  0 for 
any closed curve C.

Three Men and Two Theorems 
Although two of the most important theorems in vector calculus are named after George Green 
and George Stokes, a third man, William Thomson (also known as Lord Kelvin), played a large 
role in the formulation, dissemination, and application of both of these results. All three men 
were interested in how the two theorems could help to explain and predict physical phenomena 
in electricity and magnetism and fluid flow. The basic facts of the story are given in the margin 
notes on pages 1084 and 1121. 
Write a report on the historical origins of Green’s Theorem and Stokes’ Theorem. Explain the 
similarities and relationship between the theorems. Discuss the roles that Green, Thomson, and 
Stokes played in discovering these theorems and making them widely known. Show how both 
theorems arose from the investigation of electricity and magnetism and were later used to study a 
variety of physical problems. 
The dictionary edited by Gillispie [2] is a good source for both biographical and scientific 
information. The book by Hutchinson [5] gives an account of Stokes’ life and the book by 
Thompson [8] is a biography of Lord Kelvin. The articles by Grattan-Guinness [3] and Gray [4] 
and the book by Cannell [1] give background on the extraordinary life and works of Green. 
Additional historical and mathematical information is found in the books by Katz [6] and 
Kline [7].

SECTION 16.9 THE DIVERGENCE THEOREM .... 1127 

|||| 16.9 The Divergence Theorem 

|||| The Divergence Theorem is sometimes called 
Gauss’s Theorem after the great German mathematician 
Karl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855), who 
discovered this theorem during his investigation 
of electrostatics. In Eastern Europe the Divergence 
Theorem is known as Ostrogradsky’s 
Theorem after the Russian mathematician 
Mikhail Ostrogradsky (1801–1862), who 
published this result in 1826. 

In Section 16.5 we rewrote Green’s Theorem in a vector version as 

yF  n ds  yy div Fx, y dA 

C 

D

where C is the positively oriented boundary curve of the plane region D. If we were seeking 
to extend this theorem to vector fields on 3, we might make the guess that 

1 
yyF  n dS  yyy div Fx, y, z dV 

SE

where S is the boundary surface of the solid region E. It turns out that Equation 1 is true, 
under appropriate hypotheses, and is called the Divergence Theorem. Notice its similarity 
to Green’s Theorem and Stokes’ Theorem in that it relates the integral of a derivative of a 
function (div F in this case) over a region to the integral of the original function F over the 
boundary of the region. 

At this stage you may wish to review the various types of regions over which we were 
able to evaluate triple integrals in Section 15.7. We state and prove the Divergence Theorem 
for regions E that are simultaneously of types 1, 2, and 3 and we call such regions 
simple solid regions. (For instance, regions bounded by ellipsoids or rectangular boxes are 
simple solid regions.) The boundary of E is a closed surface, and we use the convention, 
introduced in Section 16.7, that the positive orientation is outward; that is, the unit normal 
vector n is directed outward from E. 

The Divergence Theorem Let E be a simple solid region and let S be the boundary 
surface of E, given with positive (outward) orientation. Let F be a vector field 
whose component functions have continuous partial derivatives on an open region 
that contains E. Then 

yyF  dS  yyy div F dV

E  x, y, zx, y  D, u1x, y 
 z 
 u2x, y 

where D is the projection of E onto the xy-plane. By Equation 15.7.6, we have

The boundary surface S consists of three pieces: the bottom surface S1, the top surface 
S2, and possibly a vertical surface S3, which lies above the boundary curve of D. (See 
Figure 1. It might happen that S3 doesn’t appear, as in the case of a sphere.) Notice that 
on S3 we have k  n  0, because k is vertical and n is horizontal, and so 

yyR k  n dS  yy 0 dS  0 

S3 S3

Thus, regardless of whether there is a vertical surface, we can write 

6 yyR k  n dS  yyR k  n dS  yyR k  n dS 

SS1 S2 

The equation of S2 is z  u2x, y, x, y  D, and the outward normal n points 
upward, so from Equation 16.7.8 (with F replaced by R k) we have 

yyR k  n dS  yyRx, y, u2x, y dA 

S2 D 

On S1 we have z  u1x, y, but here the outward normal n points downward, so we 
multiply by 1:

Although we have proved the Divergence Theorem only for simple solid regions, it can 
be proved for regions that are finite unions of simple solid regions. (The procedure is similar 
to the one we used in Section 16.4 to extend Green’s Theorem.) 

For example, let’s consider the region E that lies between the closed surfaces S1 and S2, 
where S1 lies inside S2. Let n1 and n2 be outward normals of S1 and S2. Then the boundary 
surface of E is S  S1  S2 and its normal n is given by n  n1 on S1 and n  n2 on S2. 
(See Figure 3.) Applying the Divergence Theorem to S, we get

where S1 is a small sphere with radius a and center the origin. You can verify that

is the rate of flow per 

unit area. If P0x0, y0, z0  is a point in the fluid and Ba is a ball with center P0 and very small 
radius a, then div FP div FP0  for all points in Ba since div F is continuous. We 
approximate the flux over the boundary sphere Sa as follows: 

yyF  dS  yyy div F dV

Equation 8 says that div FP0  is the net rate of outward flux per unit volume at P0. (This 
is the reason for the name divergence.) If div FP  0, the net flow is outward near P and 
P is called a source. If div FP  0, the net flow is inward near P and P is called a sink.

.... CHAPTER 16 VECTOR CALCULUS 

For the vector field in Figure 4, it appears that the vectors that end near P1 are shorter 
than the vectors that start near P1. Thus, the net flow is outward near P1, so div FP1 0 
and P1 is a source. Near P2, on the other hand, the incoming arrows are longer than the 
outgoing arrows. Here the net flow is inward, so div FP2  0 and P2 is a sink. We 

2 i y2 j

can use the formula for F to confirm this impression. Since F  x, we have 
div F  2x 2y, which is positive when y x. So the points above the line y  x 
are sources and those below are sinks.

The main results of this chapter are all higher-dimensional versions of the Fundamental 
Theorem of Calculus. To help you remember them, we collect them together here (without 
hypotheses) so that you can see more easily their essential similarity. Notice that in 
each case we have an integral of a “derivative” over a region on the left side, and the right 
side involves the values of the original function only on the boundary of the region.

Let S be a smooth parametric surface and let P be a point such that each line that starts at P

The figure depicts the sequence of events in each cylinder of a four-cylinder internal combustion 
engine. Each piston moves up and down and is connected by a pivoted arm to a rotating 
crankshaft. Let Pt and Vt be the pressure and volume within a cylinder at time t, where 
a  t  b gives the time required for a complete cycle. The graph shows how P and V vary

During the intake stroke (from  to ) a mixture of air and gasoline at atmospheric pressure 
is drawn into a cylinder through the intake valve as the piston moves downward. Then the 
piston rapidly compresses the mix with the valves closed in the compression stroke (from  to 
) during which the pressure rises and the volume decreases. At  the sparkplug ignites the 
fuel, raising the temperature and pressure at almost constant volume to . Then, with valves 
closed, the rapid expansion forces the piston downward during the power stroke (from  to 
). The exhaust valve opens, temperature and pressure drop, and mechanical energy stored in 
a rotating flywheel pushes the piston upward, forcing the waste products out of the exhaust 
valve in the exhaust stroke. The exhaust valve closes and the intake valve opens. We’re now 
back at  and the cycle starts again.

The charge in an electric 
(Chapter) 
circuit is governed by the 
differential equations that 
we solve in Section 17.3. 

Second-Order Differential Equations 



The basic ideas of differential equations were explained in 
Chapter 9; there we concentrated on first-order equations. In this 
chapter we study second-order linear differential equations and 

learn how they can be applied to solve problems concerning the 
vibrations of springs and electric circuits. We will also see how 
infinite series can be used to solve differential equations. 

|||| 17.1 Second-Order Linear Equations 

A second-order linear differential equation has the form 

1 
d2y dy

Px Qx Rxy  Gx 

dx2 dx 

where P, Q, R, and G are continuous functions. We saw in Section 9.1 that equations of 
this type arise in the study of the motion of a spring. In Section 17.3 we will further pursue 
this application as well as the application to electric circuits. 

In this section we study the case where Gx  0, for all x, in Equation 1. Such equations 
are called homogeneous linear equations. Thus, the form of a second-order linear 
homogeneous differential equation is 

2 
d2 y dy

Px Qx Rxy  0 

dx2 dx 

If Gx  0 for some x, Equation 1 is nonhomogeneous and is discussed in Section 17.2. 

Two basic facts enable us to solve homogeneous linear equations. The first of these says 
that if we know two solutions y1 and y2 of such an equation, then the linear combination 
y  c1y1 c2y2 is also a solution. 

3 
Theorem If y1x and y2x are both solutions of the linear homogeneous equation 
(2) and c1 and c2 are any constants, then the function 
yx  c1y1x c2y2x 

is also a solution of Equation 2. 

Proof Since y1 and y2 are solutions of Equation 2, we have 
Pxy1Qxy1

Rxy1  0 
and Pxy2Qxy2

Rxy2  0 



1142 .... CHAPTER 17 SECOND-ORDER DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS 

Therefore, using the basic rules for differentiation, we have 

PxyQxyRxy 
 Pxc1y1 c2y2Qxc1y1 c2y2Rxc1y1 c2y2 
 Pxc1y1c2y2 Qxc1y1 Rxc1y1 c2y2

Rxy1  c2Pxy2Qxy2

 c10 c20  0 

Thus, y  c1y1 c2y2 is a solution of Equation 2. 


The other fact we need is given by the following theorem, which is proved in more 
advanced courses. It says that the general solution is a linear combination of two linearly 
independent solutions y1 and y2. This means that neither y1 nor y2 is a constant multiple 
of the other. For instance, the functions fx  x2 and tx  5x2 are linearly dependent, 
but fx  ex and tx  xex are linearly independent. 

Theorem If and are linearly independent solutions of Equation 2, and 
is never 0, then the general solution is given by 
where and are arbitrary constants. c2c1 
yx  c1y1x c2y2x 
Pxy2y14 
Theorem 4 is very useful because it says that if we know two particular linearly independent 
solutions, then we know every solution. 

In general, it is not easy to discover particular solutions to a second-order linear equation. 
But it is always possible to do so if the coefficient functions P, Q, and R are constant 
functions, that is, if the differential equation has the form 

5 
aybycy  0 

where a, b, and c are constants and a  0. 

It’s not hard to think of some likely candidates for particular solutions of Equation 5 if 
we state the equation verbally. We are looking for a function y such that a constant times 
its second derivative yplus another constant times yplus a third constant times y is equal 
to 0. We know that the exponential function y  erx (where r is a constant) has the prop


rx 2rx

erty that its derivative is a constant multiple of itself: y re. Furthermore, y re. 
If we substitute these expressions into Equation 5, we see that y  erx is a solution if 

2rx  0

arerx brerx ce

rx  0

or ar2 br ce

rx rx

But eis never 0. Thus, y  eis a solution of Equation 5 if r is a root of the equation 

6 
ar2 br c  0 

Equation 6 is called the auxiliary equation (or characteristic equation) of the differential 
equation aybycy  0. Notice that it is an algebraic equation that is obtained 
from the differential equation by replacing yby r2, yby r, and y by 1.

y of the differential equation that also satisfies initial conditions of the form

and uniqueness of a solution to this initial-value problem. Examples 5 and 6 illustrate the 
technique for solving such a problem.

In this section we learn how to solve second-order nonhomogeneous linear differential equations 
with constant coefficients, that is, equations of the form

aybycy  Gx 


1148 .... CHAPTER 17 SECOND-ORDER DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS 

where a, b, and c are constants and G is a continuous function. The related homogeneous 
equation 

2 
aybycy  0 

is called the complementary equation and plays an important role in the solution of the 
original nonhomogeneous equation (1). 

Theorem The general solution of the nonhomogeneous differential equation (1) 
can be written as 
where is a particular solution of Equation 1 and is the general solution of the 
complementary Equation 2.

Proof All we have to do is verify that if y is any solution of Equation 1, then y yp is a 
solution of the complementary Equation 2. Indeed

We know from Section 17.1 how to solve the complementary equation. (Recall that the 
solution is yc  c1y1 c2y2, where y1 and y2 are linearly independent solutions of Equation 
2.) Therefore, Theorem 3 says that we know the general solution of the nonhomogeneous 
equation as soon as we know a particular solution yp. There are two methods for 
finding a particular solution: The method of undetermined coefficients is straightforward 
but works only for a restricted class of functions G. The method of variation of parameters 
works for every function G but is usually more difficult to apply in practice. 

The Method of Undetermined Coefficients 

We first illustrate the method of undetermined coefficients for the equation 

aybycy  Gx 

where Gx) is a polynomial. It is reasonable to guess that there is a particular solution 
yp that is a polynomial of the same degree as G because if y is a polynomial, then 
aybycy is also a polynomial. We therefore substitute ypx  a polynomial (of the 
same degree as G) into the differential equation and determine the coefficients. 

EXAMPLE 1 Solve the equation yy2y  x2. 
SOLUTION The auxiliary equation of yy2y  0 is 
r2 r 2  r 1r 2  0

Since Gx  x2 is a polynomial of degree 2, we seek a particular solution of the form 
ypx  Ax2 Bx C 
Then yp 2Ax B and yp 2A so, substituting into the given differential equation, we 
have 

2A 2Ax B 2Ax2 Bx C  x2 
or 2Ax2 2A 2Bx 2A B 2C  x2 
Polynomials are equal when their coefficients are equal. Thus 

2A  12A 2B  02A B 2C  0 
The solution of this system of equations is 

113

A  B  C  

224 

A particular solution is therefore

y  yc yp  c1e2 x2 x 4 


If Gx (the right side of Equation 1) is of the form Cekx, where C and k are constants, 
then we take as a trial solution a function of the same form, ypx  Aekx, because the 

kx kx

derivatives of eare constant multiples of e. 

3x

EXAMPLE 2 Solve y4y  e. 
SOLUTION The auxiliary equation is r2 4  0 with roots 2i, so the solution of the 
complementary equation is 
ycx  c1 cos 2x c2 sin 2x 
For a particular solution we try ypx  Ae3x. Then yp
 3Ae3x and yp 9Ae3x. Substituting 
into the differential equation, we have 
9Ae3x 4Ae3x   e3x 
so 13Ae3x  e3x and A  131 . Thus, a particular solution is 
x  13x

yp13 e

and the general solution is 
yx  c1 cos 2x c2 sin 2x 131 e3x 


If Gx is either C cos kx or C sin kx, then, because of the rules for differentiating the 
sine and cosine functions, we take as a trial particular solution a function of the form 

ypx  A cos kx B sin kx 


1150 .... CHAPTER 17 SECOND-ORDER DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS 

EXAMPLE 3 Solve yy2y  sin x. 
SOLUTION We try a particular solution 

ypx  A cos x B sin x 
Then yp
 A sin x B cos x yp A cos x B sin x 

so substitution in the differential equation gives 

A cos x B sin x A sin x B cos x 2A cos x B sin x  sin x 
or 3A B cos x A 3B sin x  sin x 

This is true if 

3A B  0 and A 3B  1 

The solution of this system is 
A  1

In Example 1 we determined that the solution of the complementary equation is

yc  c1ec2e. Thus, the general solution of the given equation is 
x 2x 1 

yx  c1ec2 e10 cos x 3sin x 

If Gx is a product of functions of the preceding types, then we take the trial solution 
to be a product of functions of the same type. For instance, in solving the differential 
equation 

y2y4y  x cos 3x 

we would try 

ypx  Ax B cos 3x Cx D sin 3x 
If Gx is a sum of functions of these types, we use the easily verified principle of superposition, 
which says that if yp1 and yp2 are solutions of 
aybycy  G1x aybycy  G2x 
respectively, then yp1 yp2 is a solution of 
aybycy  G1x G2x 

EXAMPLE 4 Solve y4y  xex cos 2x. 
SOLUTION The auxiliary equation is r2 4  0 with roots 2, so the solution of the com

plementary equation is ycx  c1ec2 e. For the equation y4y  xewe try

Then yp1 Ax A Be, yp1 Ax 2A Be, so substitution in the equation

or 
3Ax 2A 3Bex  xe

yp1x  (31 x 92 )eFor the equation y4y  cos 2x, we try

or 8C cos 2x 8D sin 2x  cos 2x 
Therefore, 8C  1, 8D  0, and 
yp2x  81 cos 2x 
By the superposition principle, the general solution is 

y  yc yp1 yp2  c1e2x c2 e2x (13 x 92 )ex 81 cos 2x 


Finally we note that the recommended trial solution yp sometimes turns out to be a solution 
of the complementary equation and therefore can’t be a solution of the nonhomogeneous 
equation. In such cases we multiply the recommended trial solution by x (or by x2 
if necessary) so that no term in ypx is a solution of the complementary equation. 

EXAMPLE 5 Solve yy  sin x. 
SOLUTION The auxiliary equation is r2 1  0 with roots i, so the solution of the complementary 
equation is 
ycx  c1 cos x c2 sin x 
Ordinarily, we would use the trial solution 
ypx  A cos x B sin x 
but we observe that it is a solution of the complementary equation, so instead we try 
ypx  Ax cos x Bx sin x

We summarize the method of undetermined coefficients as follows: 

kxPx. 
kxQx

1. 
If Gx  e, where P is a polynomial of degree n, then try ypx  e, 
where Qx is an nth-degree polynomial (whose coefficients are determined by 
substituting in the differential equation.) 
2. 
If Gx  ekxPx cos mx or Gx  ekxPx sin mx, where P is an nth-degree 
polynomial, then try 
ypx  ekxQx cos mx ekxRx sin mx 

where Q and R are nth-degree polynomials. 

Modification: If any term of yp is a solution of the complementary equation, multiply yp 
by x (or by x2 if necessary). 

EXAMPLE 6 Determine the form of the trial solution for the differential equation 
y4y13y  e2x cos 3x. 

SOLUTION Here Gx has the form of part 2 of the summary, where k  2, m  3, and 
Px  1. So, at first glance, the form of the trial solution would be 

ypx  e2xA cos 3x B sin 3x 

But the auxiliary equation is r2 4r 13  0, with roots r  2 3i, so the solution 
of the complementary equation is 

ycx  e2xc1 cos 3x c2 sin 3x 

This means that we have to multiply the suggested trial solution by x. So, instead, we 
use 

ypx  xe2xA cos 3x B sin 3x 

The Method of Variation of Parameters 

Suppose we have already solved the homogeneous equation aybycy  0 and written 
the solution as 

4
yx  c1y1x c2y2x 

where y1 and y2 are linearly independent solutions. Let’s replace the constants (or parame



SECTION 17.2 NONHOMOGENEOUS LINEAR EQUATIONS .... 1153 

ters) c1 and c2 in Equation 4 by arbitrary functions u1x and u2x. We look for a particular 
solution of the nonhomogeneous equation aybycy  Gx of the form 

5 
ypx  u1xy1x u2xy2x 

(This method is called variation of parameters because we have varied the parameters c1 
and c2 to make them functions.) Differentiating Equation 5, we get 

6 
u2 y2

yp u1y1 u2y2  u1 y1

Since u1 and u2 are arbitrary functions, we can impose two conditions on them. One condition 
is that yp is a solution of the differential equation; we can choose the other condition 
so as to simplify our calculations. In view of the expression in Equation 6, let’s impose the 
condition that

u1y1 u2y2  0 

Then yp u1y1u2y2u1 y1u2 y2

Equations 7 and 9 form a system of two equations in the unknown functions u1and u2.

solution is given by Equation 5.

Second-order linear differential equations have a variety of applications in science and 
engineering. In this section we explore two of them: the vibration of springs and electric 
circuits. 

Vibrating Springs 

We consider the motion of an object with mass m at the end of a spring that is either vertical 
(as in Figure 1) or horizontal on a level surface (as in Figure 2). 

In Section 6.4 we discussed Hooke’s Law, which says that if the spring is stretched (or 
compressed) x units from its natural length, then it exerts a force that is proportional to x:

EXAMPLE 1 A spring with a mass of 2 kg has natural length 0.5 m. A force of 25.6 N is 
required to maintain it stretched to a length of 0.7 m. If the spring is stretched to a length 
of 0.7 m and then released with initial velocity 0, find the position of the mass at any 
time .t 

SOLUTION From Hooke’s Law, the force required to stretch the spring is 

k0.2  25.6 

so k  25.60.2  128. Using this value of the spring constant k, together with m  2 
in Equation 1, we have

As in the earlier general discussion, the solution of this equation is

xt  c1 cos 8t  c2 sin 8t 

We are given the initial condition that x0  0.2. But, from Equation 2, x0  c1. 
Therefore, c1  0.2. Differentiating Equation 2, we get 

xt  8c1 sin 8t  8c2 cos 8t 

Since the initial velocity is given as x0  0, we have c2  0 and so the solution is 

xt  15 cos 8t 

Damped Vibrations 

We next consider the motion of a spring that is subject to a frictional force (in the case of 
the horizontal spring of Figure 2) or a damping force (in the case where a vertical spring 
moves through a fluid as in Figure 3). An example is the damping force supplied by a 
shock absorber in a car or a bicycle. 

We assume that the damping force is proportional to the velocity of the mass and acts 

in the direction opposite to the motion. (This has been confirmed, at least approximately, 

by some physical experiments.) Thus

Since c, m, and k are all positive, we have sc2  4mk  c, so the roots r1 and r2 given by 
Equations 4 must both be negative. This shows that x l 0 as t l . Typical graphs of 
x as a function of t are shown in Figure 4. Notice that oscillations do not occur. (It’s possible 
for the mass to pass through the equilibrium position once, but only once.) This is 
because c2 	 4mk means that there is a strong damping force (high-viscosity oil or grease)

It is similar to Case I, and typical graphs resemble those in Figure 4 (see Exercise 12), but 
the damping is just sufficient to suppress vibrations. Any decrease in the viscosity of the 
fluid leads to the vibrations of the following case.

Electric Circuits 

R 
In Sections 9.3 and 9.6 we were able to use first-order separable and linear equations to 
analyze electric circuits that contain a resistor and inductor (see Figure 5 on page 603 or 
Figure 4 on page 635) or a resistor and capacitor (see Exercise 29 on page 637). Now that 

switch 

we know how to solve second-order linear equations, we are in a position to analyze the 

L 
circuit shown in Figure 7. It contains an electromotive force E (supplied by a battery or 
generator), a resistor R, an inductor L, and a capacitor C, in series. If the charge on the 

E
capacitor at time t is Q  Qt, then the current is the rate of change of Q with respect 
to t : I  dQdt. As in Section 9.6, it is known from physics that the voltage drops across 
C 
the resistor, inductor, and capacitor are 

FIGURE 7

respectively. Kirchhoff’s voltage law says that the sum of these voltage drops is equal to 
the supplied voltage: 

dI Q

Since I  dQdt, this equation becomes

d 2Q dQ 1 

L  R  Q  Et

which is a second-order linear differential equation with constant coefficients. If the charge 
Q0 and the current I0 are known at time 0, then we have the initial conditions 
Q0  Q0 Q0  I0  I0 
and the initial-value problem can be solved by the methods of Section 17.2.

can see that it is the same as (3). To obtain (4) 
we replaced n by n 2 and began the summation 
at 0 instead of 2. 

Many differential equations can’t be solved explicitly in terms of finite combinations of 
simple familiar functions. This is true even for a simple-looking equation like 

1 
y2xyy  0 

But it is important to be able to solve equations such as Equation 1 because they arise from 
physical problems and, in particular, in connection with the Schrödinger equation in quantum 
mechanics. In such a case we use the method of power series; that is, we look for a 
solution of the form

The method is to substitute this expression into the differential equation and determine the 
values of the coefficients c0, c1, c2, . . . . This technique resembles the method of undetermined 
coefficients discussed in Section 17.2. 

Before using power series to solve Equation 1, we illustrate the method on the simpler 
equation yy  0 in Example 1. It’s true that we already know how to solve this equation 
by the techniques of Section 17.1, but it’s easier to understand the power series 
method when it is applied to this simpler equation.

If two power series are equal, then the corresponding coefficients must be equal. Therefore, 
the coefficients of xn in Equation 5 must be 0:

Equation 6 is called a recursion relation. If c0 and c1 are known, this equation allows 

us to determine the remaining coefficients recursively by putting n  0, 1, 2, 3, ... in 

succession.

SECTION 17.4 SERIES SOLUTIONS .... 1165 

NOTE 1  We recognize the series obtained in Example 1 as being the Maclaurin series 
for cos x and sin x. (See Equations 11.10.16 and 11.10.15.) Therefore, we could write the 
solution as 

yx  c0 cos x c1 sin x 
But we are not usually able to express power series solutions of differential equations in 
terms of known functions.

can use these power series expressions for y1 and y2 to compute approximate values of the

|||| A Numbers, Inequalities, and Absolute Values 


Calculus is based on the real number system. We start with the integers: 

..., 3, 2, 1,0,1, 2, 3,4,... 

Then we construct the rational numbers, which are ratios of integers. Thus, any rational 
number r can be expressed as 

m 

r  where m and n are integers and n  0 

n 

Examples are 

1 346  46

0.17  17 

271 100 

(Recall that division by 0 is always ruled out, so expressions like 30 and 00 are undefined.) 
Some real numbers, such as s2, can’t be expressed as a ratio of integers and are therefore 
called irrational numbers. It can be shown, with varying degrees of difficulty, that the following 
are also irrational numbers: 

3

s3 s5 s2 

sin 1 log10 2 

The set of all real numbers is usually denoted by the symbol . When we use the word 
number without qualification, we mean “real number.” 

Every number has a decimal representation. If the number is rational, then the corresponding 
decimal is repeating. For example, 

12 

2  0.5000...  0.50 3  0.66666...  0.6 

157 9 

495  0.317171717...  0.317 7  1.285714285714...  1.285714 

(The bar indicates that the sequence of digits repeats forever.) On the other hand, if the 
number is irrational, the decimal is nonrepeating: 

s2  1.414213562373095... 


 3.141592653589793... 
If we stop the decimal expansion of any number at a certain place, we get an approximation 
to the number. For instance, we can write 

 3.14159265 
where the symbol  is read “is approximately equal to.” The more decimal places we 
retain, the better the approximation we get. 

The real numbers can be represented by points on a line as in Figure 1. The positive 
direction (to the right) is indicated by an arrow. We choose an arbitrary reference point O, 
called the origin, which corresponds to the real number 0. Given any convenient unit of 
measurement, each positive number x is represented by the point on the line a distance of 
x units to the right of the origin, and each negative number x is represented by the point 
x units to the left of the origin. Thus, every real number is represented by a point on the 
line, and every point P on the line corresponds to exactly one real number. The number 
associated with the point P is called the coordinate of P and the line is then called a coor

APPENDIX A NUMBERS, INEQUALITIES, AND ABSOLUTE VALUES .... A3 

dinate line, or a real number line, or simply a real line. Often we identify the point with 
its coordinate and think of a number as being a point on the real line.

The real numbers are ordered. We say a is less than b and write a b if b a is a positive 
number. Geometrically, this means that a lies to the left of b on the number line. 
(Equivalently, we say b is greater than a and write b a.) The symbol a b (or b a) 
means that either a b or a  b and is read “a is less than or equal to b.” For instance, 
the following are true inequalities: 

7 7.4 7.5 


s2 2 s2 22 2 


In what follows we need to use set notation. A set is a collection of objects, and these 
objects are called the elements of the set. If S is a set, the notation a  S means that a is 
an element of S, and a  S means that a is not an element of S. For example, if Z repre


sents the set of integers, then 3  Z but 

 Z. If S and T 
are sets, then their union 

S  T is the set consisting of all elements that are in S or T (or in both S and T ). The intersection 
of S and T is the set S  T consisting of all elements that are in both S and T. In 
other words, S  T is the common part of S and T. The empty set, denoted by Ø, is the 
set that contains no element. 

Some sets can be described by listing their elements between braces. For instance, the 
set A consisting of all positive integers less than 7 can be written as 

A  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 

We could also write A in set-builder notation as 

A  x  x is an integer and 0 x 7 

which is read “A is the set of x such that x is an integer and 0 x 7.” 

Intervals 

Certain sets of real numbers, called intervals, occur frequently in calculus and correspond 
geometrically to line segments. For example, if a b, the open interval from a to b consists 
of all numbers between a and b and is denoted by the symbol a, b	. Using set-builder 
notation, we can write 

a, b	  x  a x b 


ab 

Notice that the endpoints of the interval—namely, a and b—are excluded. This is indicated 
FIGURE 2 by the round brackets 	 and by the open dots in Figure 2. The closed interval from a to 
b is the set

Open interval (a, b) 

a, b  x  a x b 


ab Here the endpoints of the interval are included. This is indicated by the square brackets  
FIGURE 3 and by the solid dots in Figure 3. It is also possible to include only one endpoint in an inter-

Table of Intervals 
|||| Table 1 lists the nine possible types of intervals. 
When these intervals are discussed, it is 
always assumed that a  b.

We also need to consider infinite intervals such as 

a, 
	  x  x  a 

This does not mean that 
 (“infinity”) is a number. The notation a, 
	 stands for the set 
of all numbers that are greater than a, so the symbol 
 simply indicates that the interval 
extends indefinitely far in the positive direction. 

Inequalities 

When working with inequalities, note the following rules. 

2 
Rules for Inequalities 
1. If a  b, then a 	 c  b 	 c. 
2. If a  b and c  d, then a 	 c  b 	 d. 
3. If a  b and c  0, then ac  bc. 
4. If a  b and c  0, then ac  bc. 
5. If 0  a  b, then 1
a  1
b. 
Rule 1 says that we can add any number to both sides of an inequality, and Rule 2 says 
that two inequalities can be added. However, we have to be careful with multiplication. 
Rule 3 says that we can multiply both sides of an inequality by a positive number, but 

| Rule 4 says that if we multiply both sides of an inequality by a negative number, then we 
reverse the direction of the inequality. For example, if we take the inequality 3  5 and 
multiply by 2, we get 6  10, but if we multiply by 2, we get 6 10. Finally, Rule 5 
says that if we take reciprocals, then we reverse the direction of an inequality (provided 
the numbers are positive). 

EXAMPLE 1 Solve the inequality 1 	 x  7x 	 5. 

SOLUTION The given inequality is satisfied by some values of x but not by others. To solve 
an inequality means to determine the set of numbers x for which the inequality is true. 
This is called the solution set.

use a graphing device to graph the parabola 
y  x 2  5x 	 6 (as in Figure 4) and observe 
that the curve lies on or below the x-axis when 
2  x  3. 

APPENDIX A NUMBERS, INEQUALITIES, AND ABSOLUTE VALUES .... A5 

First we subtract 1 from each side of the inequality (using Rule 1 with c  1): 
x  7x 	 4 
Then we subtract 7x from both sides (Rule 1 with c  7x): 
6x  4 
Now we divide both sides by 6 (Rule 4 with c  61): 
x 64  32 

These steps can all be reversed, so the solution set consists of all numbers greater than 
23. In other words, the solution of the inequality is the interval (32, 
). 


EXAMPLE 2 Solve the inequalities 4  3x  2  13. 
SOLUTION Here the solution set consists of all values of x that satisfy both inequalities. 
Using the rules given in (2), we see that the following inequalities are equivalent: 


4  3x  2  13 
6  3x  15(add 2) 
2  x  5(divide by 3) 


Therefore, the solution set is 2, 5	. 
EXAMPLE 3 Solve the inequality x2  5x 	 6  0. 
SOLUTION First we factor the left side: 
x  2	x  3	  0 
We know that the corresponding equation x  2	x  3	  0 has the solutions 2 and 3. 
The numbers 2 and 3 divide the real line into three intervals: 

, 2	2, 3	3, 
	 
On each of these intervals we determine the signs of the factors. For instance, 
x  
, 2	 ? x  2 ? x  2  0 
Then we record these signs in the following chart: 


x 
y 
y=˜-5x+6 
1 2 3 4 
Another method for obtaining the information in the chart is to use test values. For 

instance, if we use the test value x  1 for the interval 
, 2	, then substitution in 

x2  5x 	 6 gives

The polynomial doesn’t change sign inside any of the three intervals, so we 
conclude that it is positive on . 
Then we read from the chart that is negative when . Thus,

EXAMPLE 4 Solve x3 	 3x2  4x. 

SOLUTION First we take all nonzero terms to one side of the inequality sign and factor the 
resulting expression: 

x3 	 3x2  4x  0 or xx  1	x 	 4	  0 

As in Example 3 we solve the corresponding equation xx  1	x 	 4	  0 and use the 
solutions x  4, x  0, and x  1 to divide the real line into four intervals 
, 4	, 
4, 0	, 0, 1	, and 1, 
	. On each interval the product keeps a constant sign as shown 
in the following chart:

Absolute Value 

The absolute value of a number a, denoted by  a , is the distance from a to 0 on the real 
number line. Distances are always positive or 0, so we have 
 a   0 for every number a 
For example,

Recall that the symbol s means “the positive square root of.” Thus, sr  s means 

| s2  r and s  0. Therefore, the equation sa2  a is not always true. It is true only when 
a  0. If a  0, then a  0, so we have sa2  a. In view of (3), we then have the

For solving equations or inequalities involving absolute values, it’s often very helpful 
to use the following statements. 

6 
Suppose a  0. Then 
4. x   a if and only if x  a 
5. x   a if and only if a  x  a 
6. x   a if and only if x  a or x a 
For instance, the inequality x   a says that the distance from x to the origin is less 
than a, and you can see from Figure 7 that this is true if and only if x lies between a and a. 
If a and b are any real numbers, then the distance between a and b is the absolute value 
of the difference, namely, a  b , which is also equal to b  a . (See Figure 8.) 

EXAMPLE 6 Solve 2x  5   3. 
SOLUTION By Property 4 of (6), 2x  5   3 is equivalent to 


2x  5  3 or 2x  5  3 

So 2x  8 or 2x  2. Thus, x  4 or x  1.

Another important property of absolute value, called the Triangle Inequality, is used frequently 
not only in calculus but throughout mathematics in general. 

7 
The Triangle Inequality If a and b are any real numbers, then 

 a 	b   a  	 b  

Observe that if the numbers a and b are both positive or both negative, then the two 
sides in the Triangle Inequality are actually equal. But if a and b have opposite signs, 
the left side involves a subtraction and the right side does not. This makes the Triangle 
Inequality seem reasonable, but we can prove it as follows. 

Notice that 

 a  a  a  

is always true because a equals either  a  or  a . The corresponding statement for b is 

 b  b  b  

Adding these inequalities, we get 

( a  	 b ) a 	b  a  	 b  

If we now apply Properties 4 and 5 (with x replaced by a 	b and a by  a  	 b ),we 
obtain 

 a 	b   a  	 b  

which is what we wanted to show.

|||| B Coordinate Geometry and Lines 

Just as the points on a line can be identified with real numbers by assigning them coordinates, 
as described in Appendix A, so the points in a plane can be identified with ordered 
pairs of real numbers. We start by drawing two perpendicular coordinate lines that intersect 
at the origin O on each line. Usually one line is horizontal with positive direction to 
the right and is called the x-axis; the other line is vertical with positive direction upward 
and is called the y-axis. 

Any point P in the plane can be located by a unique ordered pair of numbers as follows. 
Draw lines through P perpendicular to the x- and y-axes. These lines intersect the axes in 
points with coordinates a and b as shown in Figure 1. Then the point P is assigned the 
ordered pair a, b	. The first number a is called the x-coordinate of P; the second number 
b is called the y-coordinate of P. We say that P is the point with coordinates a, b	, and 
we denote the point by the symbol Pa, b	. Several points are labeled with their coordinates 
in Figure 2.

By reversing the preceding process we can start with an ordered pair a, b	 and arrive 
at the corresponding point P. Often we identify the point P with the ordered pair a, b	 and 
refer to “the point a, b	.” [Although the notation used for an open interval a, b	 is the 


APPENDIX B COORDINATE GEOMETRY AND LINES .... A11 

same as the notation used for a point a, b	, you will be able to tell from the context which 
meaning is intended.] 

This coordinate system is called the rectangular coordinate system or the Cartesian 
coordinate system in honor of the French mathematician René Descartes (1596–1650), 
even though another Frenchman, Pierre Fermat (1601–1665), invented the principles of 
analytic geometry at about the same time as Descartes. The plane supplied with this coordinate 
system is called the coordinate plane or the Cartesian plane and is denoted by 2. 

The x- and y-axes are called the coordinate axes and divide the Cartesian plane into 
four quadrants, which are labeled I, II, III, and IV in Figure 1. Notice that the first quadrant 
consists of those points whose x- and y-coordinates are both positive. 

EXAMPLE 1 Describe and sketch the regions given by the following sets.

The given region consists of those points in the plane whose y-coordinates lie between 

1 and 1. Thus, the region consists of all points that lie between (but not on) the horizontal 
lines y  1 and y  1. [These lines are shown as dashed lines in Figure 3(c) to 
indicate that the points on these lines don’t lie in the set.] 
Recall from Appendix A that the distance between points a and b on a number line is 
 a  b    b  a . Thus, the distance between points P1x1, y1	 and P3x2, y1	 on a horizontal 
line must be  x2  x1  and the distance between P2x2, y2 	 and P3x2, y1	 on a vertical 
line must be  y2  y1 . (See Figure 4.)

Lines 

We want to find an equation of a given line L; such an equation is satisfied by the coordinates 
of the points on L and by no other point. To find the equation of L we use its slope, 
which is a measure of the steepness of the line. 

2 
Definition The slope of a nonvertical line that passes through the points 
P1x1, y1 and P2x2, y2  is 
yy2  y1 

m  

xx2  x1 

The slope of a vertical line is not defined. 

Thus, the slope of a line is the ratio of the change in y, y, to the change in x, x. (See 
Figure 5.) The slope is therefore the rate of change of y with respect to x. The fact that the 
line is straight means that the rate of change is constant. 

Figure 6 shows several lines labeled with their slopes. Notice that lines with positive 
slope slant upward to the right, whereas lines with negative slope slant downward to the 
right. Notice also that the steepest lines are the ones for which the absolute value of the 
slope is largest, and a horizontal line has slope 0. 

Now let’s find an equation of the line that passes through a given point P1x1, y1 and 
has slope m. A point Px, y with x  x1 lies on this line if and only if the slope of the line 
through P1 and P is equal to m; that is, 

y  y1

This equation can be rewritten in the form

EXAMPLE 3 Find an equation of the line through 1, 7 with slope 21. 
SOLUTION Using 3 with m  21, x1  1, and y1  7, we obtain an equation of the 
line as 
y  7  21 x  1 
which we can rewrite as 
2y  14  x  1 or x  2y  13  0 


EXAMPLE 4 Find an equation of the line through the points 1, 2 and 3, 4. 
SOLUTION By Definition 2 the slope of the line is 
4  23 

m   

3  1 2 
Using the point-slope form with x1  1 and y1  2, we obtain 

y  2  23 x  1 

which simplifies to 3x  2y  1 


Suppose a nonvertical line has slope m and y-intercept b. (See Figure 7.) This means it 
intersects the y-axis at the point 0, b, so the point-slope form of the equation of the line, 
with x1  0 and y1  b, becomes 

y  b  mx  0 

This simplifies as follows. 

Slope-Intercept Form of the Equation of a Line An equation of the line with slope 
and -intercept is 
y  mx  b 
by 
m4 
In particular, if a line is horizontal, its slope is m  0, so its equation is y  b, where 
b is the y-intercept (see Figure 8). A vertical line does not have a slope, but we can write 
its equation as x  a, where a is the x-intercept, because the x-coordinate of every point 
on the line is a. 

Observe that the equation of every line can be written in the form 

5 
Ax  By  C  0 

because a vertical line has the equation x  a or x  a  0(A  1, B  0, C  a) and 
a nonvertical line has the equation y  mx  b or mx  y  b  0(A  m, B  1, 
C  b). Conversely, if we start with a general first-degree equation, that is, an equation 
of the form (5), where A, B, and C are constants and A and B are not both 0, then we can 
show that it is the equation of a line. If B  0, the equation becomes Ax  C  0 or 
x  CA, which represents a vertical line with x-intercept CA. If B  0, the equation

and we recognize this as being the slope-intercept form of the equation of a line 
(m  AB, b  CB). Therefore, an equation of the form (5) is called a linear 
equation or the general equation of a line. For brevity, we often refer to “the line 
Ax By C  0” instead of “the line whose equation is Ax By C  0.” 

EXAMPLE 5 Sketch the graph of the equation 3x 5y  15. 

SOLUTION Since the equation is linear, its graph is a line. To draw the graph, we can simply 
find two points on the line. It’s easiest to find the intercepts. Substituting y  0 


x 

(the equation of the x-axis) in the given equation, we get 3x  15, so x  5 is the 
x-intercept. Substituting x  0 in the equation, we see that the y-intercept is 3. This 
allows us to sketch the graph as in Figure 9. 

EXAMPLE 6 Graph the inequality x 2y 5. 
SOLUTION We are asked to sketch the graph of the set x, y x 2y 5	 and we do so 
by solving the inequality for y: 
x 2y 5 

2y x 5 

y 21 x 25 

Compare this inequality with the equation y  21 x 25, which represents a line with 
slope 21 and y-intercept 25 . We see that the given graph consists of points whose 
y-coordinates are larger than those on the line y  21 x 25. Thus, the graph is the 
region that lies above the line, as illustrated in Figure 10. 

Parallel and Perpendicular Lines 

Slopes can be used to show that lines are parallel or perpendicular. The following facts are 
proved, for instance, in Precalculus: Mathematics for Calculus, Fourth Edition by Stewart, 
Redlin, and Watson (BrooksCole Publishing Co., Pacific Grove, CA, 2002). 

Parallel and Perpendicular Lines 
1. Two nonvertical lines are parallel if and only if they have the same slope. 
2. Two lines with slopes and are perpendicular if and only if ; 
that is, their slopes are negative reciprocals: 
m2  

EXAMPLE 7 Find an equation of the line through the point 5, 2 that is parallel to the line

y  

3 x 6 


APPENDIX B COORDINATE GEOMETRY AND LINES .... A15 

which is in slope-intercept form with m  32. Parallel lines have the same slope, so the 
required line has slope 32 and its equation in point-slope form is 

y  2  32 x  5 

We can write this equation as 2x  3y  16. 

EXAMPLE 8 Show that the lines 2x  3y  1 and 6x  4y  1  0 are perpendicular. 

SOLUTION The equations can be written as

y  3 x  3 and y  32 x  4 

from which we see that the slopes are

m1  3 and m2  32 

Since m1m2  1, the lines are perpendicular.

a line. In this section we discuss second-degree equations such as 

x2 y2

which represent a circle, a parabola, an ellipse, and a hyperbola, respectively. 

The graph of such an equation in x and y is the set of all points x, y that satisfy the 
equation; it gives a visual representation of the equation. Conversely, given a curve in the 
xy-plane, we may have to find an equation that represents it, that is, an equation satisfied 
by the coordinates of the points on the curve and by no other point. This is the other half 
of the basic principle of analytic geometry as formulated by Descartes and Fermat. The 
idea is that if a geometric curve can be represented by an algebraic equation, then the rules 
of algebra can be used to analyze the geometric problem. 

Circles 

As an example of this type of problem, let’s find an equation of the circle with radius r and 
center h, k. By definition, the circle is the set of all points Px, y whose distance from 


APPENDIX C GRAPHS OF SECOND-DEGREE EQUATIONS .... A17 

y 
P(x, y) 
the center is . (See Figure 1.) Thus, is on the circle if and only if . 
From the distance formula, we have 
sx  h2  y  k2  r 
 PC   rPrCh, k 
or equivalently, squaring both sides, we get 
x  h2  y  k2  r2 
0 x This is the desired equation. 
FIGURE 1

EXAMPLE 2 Sketch the graph of the equation by first showing 
that it represents a circle and then finding its center and radius. 
SOLUTION We first group the -terms and -terms as follows: yx 
x2  y2  2x  6y  7  0 
x2  2x  y2  6y  7 
Then we complete the square within each grouping, adding the appropriate constants to 
both sides of the equation: 
x2  2x  1  y2  6y  9  7  1  9 
or x  12  y  32  3 
Comparing this equation with the standard equation of a circle (1), we see that , 
, and , so the given equation represents a circle with center and 
radius . It is sketched in Figure 2. s3

Parabolas 

The geometric properties of parabolas are reviewed in Section 10.5. Here we regard a 
parabola as a graph of an equation of the form y  ax2  bx  c.

Notice that if x, y satisfies y  ax2, then so does x, y. This corresponds to the geo


metric fact that if the right half of the graph is reflected about the y-axis, then the left half 

of the graph is obtained. We say that the graph is symmetric with respect to the y-axis. 

The graph of an equation is symmetric with respect to the y-axis if the equation is 
unchanged when x is replaced by x. 

If we interchange x and y in the equation y  ax2, the result is x  ay2, which also 
represents a parabola. (Interchanging x and y amounts to reflecting about the diagonal 
line y  x.) The parabola x  ay2 opens to the right if a  0 and to the left if a  0. (See 


APPENDIX C GRAPHS OF SECOND-DEGREE EQUATIONS .... A19

EXAMPLE 4 Sketch the region bounded by the parabola x  y2 and the line y  x  2. 

SOLUTION First we find the points of intersection by solving the two equations. Substituting 
x  y  2 into the equation x  y2, we get y  2  y2, which gives 

0  y2  y  2  y  2y  1 

so y  2 or 1. Thus, the points of intersection are 4, 2 and 1, 1, and we draw 
the line y  x  2 passing through these points. We then sketch the parabola x  y2 by 
referring to Figure 6(a) and having the parabola pass through 4, 2 and 1, 1. The 
region bounded by x  y2 and y  x  2 means the finite region whose boundaries are

where a and b are positive numbers, is called an ellipse in standard position. (Geometric 

0y properties of ellipses are discussed in Section 10.5.) Observe that Equation 2 is unchanged 
if x is replaced by x or y is replaced by y, so the ellipse is symmetric with respect to 

(0, b) 

both axes. As a further aid to sketching the ellipse, we find its intercepts.

(_a, 0) 

(a, 0) 

The x-intercepts of a graph are the x-coordinates of the points where the graph 

x 

intersects the x-axis. They are found by setting y  0 in the equation of the graph. 

The y-intercepts are the y-coordinates of the points where the graph intersects the

(0, _b) 

y-axis. They are found by setting x  0 in its equation. 

2  a2

If we set y  0 in Equation 2, we get xand so the x-intercepts are 	a. Setting 

x  0, we get y2  b2, so the y-intercepts are 	b. Using this information, together with 

symmetry, we sketch the ellipse in Figure 8. If a  b, the ellipse is a circle with radius a.

This means that the hyperbola consists of two parts, called its branches. It is sketched in 
Figure 10. 

In drawing a hyperbola it is useful to draw first its asymptotes, which are the lines 
y  bax and y  bax shown in Figure 10. Both branches of the hyperbola 
approach the asymptotes; that is, they come arbitrarily close to the asymptotes. This 
involves the idea of a limit, which is discussed in Chapter 2. (See also Exercise 67 in 
Section 4.5.)

If b  a, a hyperbola has the equation x2  y2  a2 (or y2  x2  a2) and is called an 
equilateral hyperbola [see Figure 13(a)]. Its asymptotes are y  	x, which are perpendicular. 
If an equilateral hyperbola is rotated by 45

y-axes, and it can be shown that the new equation of the hyperbola is xy  k, where k is a

The standard position of an angle occurs when we place its vertex at the origin of a 
coordinate system and its initial side on the positive x-axis as in Figure 3. A positive angle 
is obtained by rotating the initial side counterclockwise until it coincides with the terminal 
side. Likewise, negative angles are obtained by clockwise rotation as in Figure 4.

If we put y  xin the addition formulas (12), we get the double-angle formulas: 

15b15a 
sin 2x  2 sin x cos x 
cos 2x  cos2x  sin2x 

Then, by using the identity sin2x  cos2x  1, we obtain the following alternate forms of 
the double-angle formulas for cos 2x: 

16b16a 
cos 2x  2 cos2x  1 
cos 2x  1  2 sin2x 

If we now solve these equations for cos2xand sin2x, we get the following half-angle formulas,

Because of the identity

(which can be verified using Equation 12a), the graph of cosine is obtained by shifting the 

graph of sine by an amount

to the left [see Figure 13(b)]. Note that for both the sine 

and cosine functions the domain is ,  and the range is the closed interval 1, 1.

The graphs of the remaining four trigonometric functions are shown in Figure 14 and

our letter S) and is called sigma notation.

Definition If am, am1, ..., an are real numbers and m and n are integers such 
This tells us to 
end with i=n. 


that m n, then

Let Sn be a statement involving the positive integer

2. If Sk is true, then Sk1 is true. 
Then Sn is true for all positive integers n.

Let 0 be given. We want to find

In order to get terms that contain  f x L  and  tx M , we add and subtract Ltx

We want to make each of these terms less than 2. 

Since limx l a tx  M, there is a number

Theorem If f x tx for all x in an open interval that contains a (except 

possibly at a) and 
lim f x  L and lim tx  M 


x l ax l a 

then L M. 
Proof We use the method of proof by contradiction. Suppose, if possible, that L M. 
Law 2 of limits says that

Therefore, for any 0, there exists 

0 such that

In particular, taking  L M (noting that L M 0 by hypothesis), we have a 

number 

0 such that 
tx f x	 M L L M whenever 0  x a  
Since a  a  for any number a, we have 

tx f x	 M L L M whenever 0  x a  
which simplifies to

But this contradicts f x tx. Thus, the inequality L M must be false. Therefore,

Since f is continuous at b, we have

Now we add to both sides of this inequality:f a 
f a f 	ax a f a f 	cx a

1 Cauchy’s Mean Value Theorem Suppose that the functions f and t are continuous 
on 	a, b
 and differentiable on a, b, and t	x  0 for all x in a, b. Then there is 
a number c in a, b such that 

f 	c f b f a

Notice that if we take the special case in which tx  x, then t	c  1 and Theorem 1 
is just the ordinary Mean Value Theorem. Furthermore, Theorem 1 can be proved in a similar 
manner. You can verify that all we have to do is change the function h given by 
Equation 4.2.4 to the function

L’Hospital’s Rule Suppose f and t are differentiable and t	x  0 near a (except 
possibly at a). Suppose that 

lim f x  0 and lim tx  0

x l ax l a 

or that lim f x  and lim tx  

x l ax l a 

(In other words, we have an indeterminate form of type 00 or .) Then 
f x f 	x 

lim  lim 

x l a tx x l a t	x 

if the limit on the right side exists (or is  or ). 

Proof of L’Hospital’s Rule We are assuming that limx l af x  0 and limx l a t x  0. Let 
f 	x 

L  lim 

x l a t	x 

We must show that limx l af  xtx  L. Define 

if x  a if x  a 

Fx  f x 
Gx  tx

Then F is continuous on I since f is continuous on x  I  x  a and 
lim Fx  lim f x  0  Fa 

x l ax l a 

Likewise, G is continuous on I. Let x  I and x  a. Then F and G are continuous on 
	a, x
 and differentiable on a, x and G	  0 there (since F	  f 	 and G	  t	). Therefore, 
by Cauchy’s Mean Value Theorem there is a number y such that a  y  x and 

F	 y Fx  Fa Fx 

G	 y Gx  Ga Gx 

Here we have used the fact that, by definition, Fa  0 and Ga  0. Now, if we let 
x l a, then y l a (since a  y  x), so 

f  x Fx F	 y f 	 y 

lim  lim  lim  lim  L 

x l a tx x l a G x y l a G	 y y l a t	 y 

A similar argument shows that the left-hand limit is also L. Therefore

This proves l’Hospital’s Rule for the case where a is finite.

SECTION 11.8 In order to prove Theorem 11.8.3 we first need the following results.

If a power series  cnxconverges when x  b (where b  0), then it

Proof of 1 Suppose that  cnconverges. Then, by Theorem 11.2.6, we have 

bn 
N such that cnbn   1 whenever n  N. Thus, for n  N, we have

If  x    b , then  xb   1, so  xb is a convergent geometric series. Therefore, 

n 
n

by the Comparison Test, the series  
nN cnx is convergent. Thus, the series  cnxis 
absolutely convergent and therefore convergent. 


dn 
nn 


Proof of 2 Suppose that  cndiverges. If x is any number such that  x    d , then 

 cnxcannot converge because, by part 1, the convergence of  cnxwould imply the 

dn 
n

convergence of  cn. Therefore,  cnxdiverges whenever  x    d . 


n

Theorem For a power series  cnxthere are only three possibilities: 

1. 
The series converges only when x  0. 
2. 
The series converges for all x. 
3. 
There is a positive number R such that the series converges if  x   R and 
diverges if  x   R. 
Proof Suppose that neither case 1 nor case 2 is true. Then there are nonzero numbers b 

n

and d such that  cnxconverges for x  b and diverges for x  d. Therefore, the set 

n

S  x  cnx converges is not empty. By the preceding theorem, the series diverges if 
 x    d , so  x    d  for all x  S. This says that  d  is an upper bound for the set S. 
Thus, by the Completeness Axiom (see Section 11.1), S has a least upper bound R. If 

n

 x   R, then x  S, so  cnxdiverges. If  x   R, then  x  is not an upper bound for 
S and so there exists b  S such that b   x . Since b  S,  cnconverges, so by the 

bn 
n

preceding theorem  cnxconverges.

Clairaut’s Theorem Suppose f is defined on a disk D that contains the point a, b. 
If the functions fxy and fyx are both continuous on D, then fxya, b  fyxa, b. 

Proof For small values of h, h  0, consider the difference 
h   fa  h, b  h  fa  h, b   fa, b  h  fa, b 
Notice that if we let tx  fx, b  h  fx, b, then

By the Mean Value Theorem, there is a number c between a and a  h such that 
ta  h  ta  tch  h fxc, b  h  fxc, b 
Applying the Mean Value Theorem again, this time to fx, we get a number d between b

fxc, b  h  fxc, b  fxyc, dh 

Combining these equations, we obtain 

h  h2fxyc, d 

If h l 0, then c, d l a, b, so the continuity of fxy at a, b gives

Proof Let 
z  f a x, b y f a, b 
According to (14.4.7), to prove that f is differentiable at a, b we have to show that we

tx  f x, b y 
is defined on the interval a, a x and tx  fxx, b y. If we apply the Mean 
Value Theorem to t, we get 

ta x ta  tu x 
where u is some number between a and a x. In terms of f , this equation becomes 
f a x, b y f a, b y  fxu, b y x 

This gives us an expression for the first part of the right side of Equation 3. For the 
second part we let hy  f a, y. Then h is a function of a single variable defined on 
the interval b, b y and hy  fya, y. A second application of the Mean Value

where 1  fxu, b y fxa, b 

2  fya, v fya, b 

Since u, b y l a, b and a, v l a, b as x, y l 0, 0 and since fx and fy 
are continuous at a, b, we see that 1 l 0 and 2 l 0 as x, y l 0, 0. 
Therefore, f is differentiable at a, b. 

A complex number can be represented by an expression of the form a bi, where a and 
b are real numbers and i is a symbol with the property that i 2  1. The complex number 
a bi can also be represented by the ordered pair a, b and plotted as a point in a 
plane (called the Argand plane) as in Figure 1. Thus, the complex number i  0 1  i is 
identified with the point 0, 1. 

The real part of the complex number a bi is the real number a and the imaginary 
part is the real number b. Thus, the real part of 4 3i is 4 and the imaginary part is 3. 
Two complex numbers a bi and c di are equal if a  c and b  d, that is, their real 
parts are equal and their imaginary parts are equal. In the Argand plane the horizontal axis 
is called the real axis and the vertical axis is called the imaginary axis. 

The sum and difference of two complex numbers are defined by adding or subtracting 
their real parts and their imaginary parts: 

a bi c di  a c b di 

a bi c di  a c b di 

For instance, 
1 i 4 7i  1 4 1 7i  5 6i

A50 .... APPENDIX G COMPLEX NUMBERS 

Division of complex numbers is much like rationalizing the denominator of a rational 
expression. For the complex number z  a  bi, we define its complex conjugate to be 
z  a  bi. To find the quotient of two complex numbers we multiply numerator and 
denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator. 

1  3i 

EXAMPLE 2 Express the number in the form a  bi. 

2  5i 

SOLUTION We multiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of 2  5i, 
namely 2  5i, and we take advantage of the result of Example 1: 

1  3i 1  3i 2  5i 13  11i 13 11 

    i 

2  5i 2  5i 2  5i 22  52 2929 


The geometric interpretation of the complex conjugate is shown in Figure 2: z is the 
reflection of z in the real axis. We list some of the properties of the complex conjugate in 
the following box. The proofs follow from the definition and are requested in Exercise 18.

Since i 2  1, we can think of i as a square root of 1. But notice that we also have 

i2  i 2  1 and so i is also a square root of 1. We say that i is the principal 

square root of 1 and write s1  i. In general, if c is any positive number, we write 

sc  sci

We observe that the solutions of the equation in Example 3 are complex conjugates of 
each other. In general, the solutions of any quadratic equation ax2 bx c  0 with real 
coefficients a, b, and c are always complex conjugates. (If z is real, z  z, so z is its own 
conjugate.)

has a solution. More generally, it is true that every polynomial equation

Repeated use of Formula 1 shows how to compute powers of a complex number. If

then

and

In general, we obtain the following result, which is named after the French mathematician 
Abraham De Moivre (1667–1754).

De Moivre’s Theorem can also be used to find the nth roots of complex numbers. An 
nth root of the complex number z is a complex number w such that 

wn  z 

Writing these two numbers in trigonometric form as 

w  scos 

 i sin 
and 

z  rcos

and using De Moivre’s Theorem, we get

ncos n

The equality of these two complex numbers shows that

and

From the fact that sine and cosine have period 

it follows that

Since this expression gives a different value of w for k  0, 1, 2,..., n  1, we have the 
following.

Roots of a Complex Number 

Let 

z  rcos

and let be a positive

wherek  0 , 1, 2,..., n  1. 


Notice that each of the nth roots of z has modulus  wk   r1
n. Thus, all the nth roots 
of z lie on the circle of radius r1
n in the complex plane. Also, since the argument of each

successive th root exceeds the argument of the previous root by 

n 

nth roots of z are equally spaced on this circle.

We also need to give a meaning to the expression ez when z  x iy is a complex number. 
The theory of infinite series as developed in Chapter 11 can be extended to the case 
where the terms are complex numbers. Using the Taylor series for ex (11.10.11) as our

roots are similar to sx. 
As n increases, the graph of 

n

y  sx becomes steeper near 
0 and flatter for x  1. 

31. 
6_6_2.52.520_2_44
If c  0, the graph has three humps: two minimum points and a 
maximum point. These humps get flatter as c increases until at 
c  0 two of the humps disappear and there is only one minimum 
point. This single hump then moves to the right and approaches the 
origin as c increases. 

33. The hump gets larger and moves to the right. 
35. If c  0, the loop is to the right of the origin; if c  0, the loop 
is to the left. The closer c is to 0, the larger the loop.

27. For c  0, there is no IP and only one extreme point, the 
origin. For c  0, there is a maximum point at the origin, two 
minimum points, and two IPs, which move downward and away 
from the origin as c l . 
4_2.3_2.12.1_3_2_114
29. There is no maximum or minimum, regardless of the value 
of c. For c  0, there is a vertical asymptote at x  0, 
limx l 0 fx  , and limx l 	 f x  1. 
c  0 is a transitional value at which f x  1 for x  0. 
For c  0, lim x l 0 fx  0, limx l 	 fx  1, and there are 
two IPs, which move away from the y-axis as c l .

31. For c  0, the maximum and minimum values are always 	21, 
but the extreme points and IPs move closer to the y-axis as c 
increases. c  0 is a transitional value: when c is replaced by c, 
the curve is reflected in the x-axis.

The function values approach 0 as x, y become large; as x, y 
approaches the origin, f approaches  or 0, depending on the 
direction of approach. 

69. If c  0, the graph is a cylindrical surface. For c  0, the level 
curves are ellipses. The graph curves upward as we leave the origin, 
and the steepness increases as c increases. For c  0, the level 
curves are hyperbolas. The graph curves upward in the y-direction 
and downward, approaching the xy-plane, in the x-direction giving 
a saddle-shaped appearance near (0, 0, 1).
